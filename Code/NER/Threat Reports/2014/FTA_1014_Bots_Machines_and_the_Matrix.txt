Executive Summary 
In the recent past, a Fidelis XPS user reported seeing detections of what appeared to be botnet-relatedmalware. While that customer was protected, we at General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutionsdecided to take a closer look. The analysis of the malicious code revealed that it appeared to beAndromeda but the delivery infrastructure looked interesting. Further telemetry from our sensors showedthat this server in China was also hosting and distributing many other malicious specimens. Analysis of the data revealed a pattern in the filenames. Our analysts used this pattern to discover other systems distributed across the globe serving up various botnet malware, so far assumed to be used in distinctcampaigns but clearly related in this case: 
-Andromeda 
-Beta Bot 
-Neutrino Bot 
-NgrBot/DorkBot 
Analysis also showed how attackers continue to benefit from the use of globally-distributed hosting providers to perform their malicious activities. Further, the analysis revealed how attackers are hostingand distributing identical copies of the malware from servers in different countries including China,Poland, Russia, and the United States. 
For the period of time researched in this activity, we observed the following targeted sectors in the US: 
-Manufacturing / Biotechnology & Drugs 
-Professional Services / Engineering 
-Information Technology / Telecommunications 
-Government / State 
Note that our footprint is largely in the Enterprise space and it is possible that we’re seeing spillover from wider campaigns. 
This document uncovers various servers hosting Bots and other related malware, provides a triageanalysis of various pieces of malware hosted by these malicious servers, and provides indicators that network defenders can use to protect their networks.

Threat Overview 
The threat activity observed in the past weeks against various targets in our customer base has shown patterns that allowed us to discover multiple servers hosting and distributing malicious software (Bots). 
As it is known by the network defenders and the security community, it is important to defend againstthese attacks since systems infected with these malicious specimens could be used for credential theft, Distributed Denial of Service Attacks, spreading malware, lateral propagation, etc. This is of great concern as the first stage attack continues to bypass network security defenses infecting user’s computers that beacon to malicious servers to download or create the second stage malware into the victim systems. 
Some of the main Bot types of malware detected through this research include: 
-­-Andromeda 
Andromeda is a modular bot that downloads modules and updates from its command and control(C&C) server during execution. The malware has both anti-VM and anti-reversing features. Itscode is obfuscated to make it more difficult for malware reverse engineers to analyze and antivirus tools to detect. 
Andromeda bot features include: self-propagation, injection into trusted processes to hide itself, network traffic encryption, download and installation of files/malware, form grabber, keylogger, ring3 rootkit, proxy, etc. Features like form grabber, rootkit, and proxy are delivered to themalware in the form of modules that are then loaded into the victim system after the malware makes a connection with its C&C. It appears that in 2012, some of the modules were sold for$500 (form grabber), $300 (Ring3 rootkit), and $200 (keylogger). 
-­-DorkBot/NgrBot 
DorkBot is a modified IRCBot that is very similar in features to NgrBot. DorkBot has a loader and a module. The bot includes the following features: process injection, hard drive wiping, etc.Different from NgrBot, DorkBot uses modified IRC commands. Some of the commands supportedinclude: !die, !dl, !http.inj, !logins, !rc,!speed, !ssyn, !stop, !up, and !udp. 
NgrBot can also be remotely controlled via Internet-Relay-Chat (IRC) protocol. It has capabilitiesto join different IRC channels to perform various attacks according to the IRC-based commandsfrom the C&C server. Its code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for malware reverse engineers to analyze and antivirus tools to detect. 
NgrBot features include: self-propagation (e.g. through USB removable drives, social networkingsites, and messaging clients), process injection, hard drive wiping, blocking access to multiple antivirus/security vendor websites, denial of service attacks, credentials stealing (usernames and passwords), download and execute file, etc. Some of the commands supported are: ~pu, ~dw, ~http.inj, ~logins, ~rc, ~speed, ~ssyn, ~stop, and ~udp. 

-­-Beta Bot 
It is said that Beta bot started out as an HTTP bot. The Bot is also known by some security vendors as ‘Trojan.Neurevt’. Its code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for malware reverse engineers to analyze and antivirus tools to detect. 
Beta bot features include: anti-VM and anti-reversing, self-propagation, rootkit, process injection, blocking access to multiple antivirus/security vendor websites, AV-disabling, form grabbing, download and execution of files, termination of competing malware communications by terminating their processes or blocking their code injections, and denial of service. It appears that in May 2013, the pre-built bot could be purchase for $320-$500, and $20 for variant rebuilds for those requiring configuration changes. According to online research, Beta Bot sales are being handled by “Lord Huron,” although “betamonkey” appears to be the author. The following image was found during online research: 




-­-Neutrino 
The Neutrino bot was advertised as an HTTP stress-testing tool. It has some of the followingfeatures: anti-VM and anti-reversing/debugging, denial of service (HTTP/TCP/UDP flood),keylogger, command shell, credential stealing, self-spreading, etc. It appears at some point thebot was sold for $550 (Builder), $200 (Full set including Bot and Admin Panel), and $20 (Update).Online research revealed the following contact information for this bot: n3utrino@kaddafi[.]me /n3utrino@xmpp[.]jp / n3utrino.blog[.]com. The following images were found during online research: The following table provides information about some of the servers hosting and distributing malware andsome of the filename patterns discovered:

Risk Assessment 
A bot malware has features like anti-reversing, credential stealing/keystroke logging/form grabbing, DNSchanger, process injection, antivirus process killing, blocking of security related websites, backdoor, and others. They also have features to spread themselves through USB removable drives, social networkingsites, and messaging clients. In addition, they could also infiltrate the network when the victim user visits a website hosting a browser exploit. 
Once the attacker gains control, the infected system could be used to launch Distributed Denial of Serviceattacks, spread the bot to other victims, download more advanced malware to perform lateralpropagation, etc. The attackers (Bot Masters/Herders) could also rent their botnets to other cybercriminals.

The Fidelis Take 

This paper highlights campaigns that has compromised systems at significant enterprises worldwide,utilizing various bot malware. We are publishing these indicators so others in the security researchcommunity can monitor for this activity and potentially correlate against other campaigns and tools thatare being investigated. 
General Dynamics Fidelis’ advanced threat defense product, Fidelis XPS™, detects all of the activity documented in this paper. Further, we will continue to follow this specific activity and actively monitor theever-evolving threat landscape for the latest threats to our customers’ security.
