The first website uses adult content as a lure, via an Android application called Fuddi Duniya, which links to a website that displays nude pictures every day. The app’s APK is linked directly fromthe homepage, with a disclaimer stating that Google Play does not allowpornography in their store. 
Figure 1: fake website with a link to download the Fuddi Duniya app. The displayed Urdu text could be translated as “Real women, girls, and housewives || Download the app now More than thousands of women app.” 
The app’s features are similar to the previous malicious Android application, such as having the ability to record audio and steal SMS, accounts, contacts and certain file types fromspecific directories. In addition, the application nowretrieves the last known location and uses the development platformGoogle Firebase to upload the stolen content.

Same as with the fake Tweety chat application we described in detail in our previous research, a Windows application with real chat features based on the open-source chat application RocketChat was offered. Similarly, this application also comes bundled with malicious .NET code. 
While small and relatively simple, we found this malicious application interesting to analyze as it revealed the countries targeted by the threat actor. The application is a simple downloader that sends some basic information (username, antivirus, IP address, and operating systemversion) encrypted using triple Data Encryption Standard (DES).

Sample 
of 
the 
app’s 
code 
Periodically, 
the 
malware 
tries 
to 
contact 
the 
Command-and-Control 
(C&C) 
server 
with 
the 
username 
encoded 
into 
parameters. 
Based 
on 
the 
information 
they 
retrieve, 
the 
operators 
can 
then 
decide 
to 
instruct 
the 
malware 
to 
download 
the 
second 
stage 
payload. 
This 
function 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
various 
versions 
of 
backdoors 
(such 
as 
sctrls 
and 
sip_telephone) 
that 
we 
analyzed 
in 
our 
previous 
blog 
post 
and 
whitepaper. 
An 
interesting 
feature 
of 
the 
downloader: 
It 
uses 
an 
online 
service 
to 
retrieve 
the 
victim’s 
IP 
address 
and 
country, 
which 
it 
compares 
with 
a 
list 
of 
allowed 
countries. 
If 
the 
victimseemingly 
comes 
froma 
different 
country, 
the 
programwill 
self-delete 
and 
quit. 
This 
list 
contains: 
Most 
of 
the 
South 
and 
Southeast 
Asian 
countries 
(including 
Mongolia) 
Most 
of 
the 
Middle

We noted that it does both client-side and server-side IP filtering, showing that the attacker has improved its infrastructure. At the end of last year, a C&C fromthe same threat actor was not only accessible fromany IP address, but it was possible to browse the server directory tree without authentication. 
After impersonating a fake victimof interest, we obtained a second stage payload (Detected as TROJ_DELF.XXWZ), which is a filestealer based on the Delphi programming language similar to the “svctrls” malware described in our previous blogpost. This one is called “sysctrls” and it looks for files with the following extensions: 
ConvertwebpagesorentirewebsitestoPDFPDFmyURL!.doc, docx  Microsoft Word document  
.xls,.xlsx  Microsoft Excel document  
.ppt, .pptx  Microsoft Powerpoint presentation  
.pptx  Microsoft Powerpoint presentation  
.png, .jpg, .jpeg  Image file  
.pst, .ost  Microsoft Outlook file  
.csv  Spreadsheet file  

It then sends themvia a POST HTTP request to windefendr[.]com/description.php. Further analysis of this filestealer revealed interesting links with other threat actor groups. 
The Delphi Link 
We already mentioned that Confucius had possible links to other groups in our previous blog post, which mentioned code sharing between Patchwork and Confucius. Both groups used a backdoor with the same configuration file structure and commands. 
We found more code shared among the two threat actor’s malware, as Patchwork recently used multiple Delphi malware similar to some of the Delphi malware we described before. 
We initially spotted some visual similarities between the malware used. Although no forms are displayed while the malware is running, we can see its TFormobject in the Delphi decompiler. The TFormobject often has two TTimer objects ― but sometimes we have seen one or even three of these objects ― usually with randomnames. Occasionally, listboxes with encrypted strings are also added.

The group still uses the Badnews malware, a backdoor with information-stealing and file-executing capabilities, albeit updated with a slight modification in the encryption routine at the end of 2017, when they added Blowfish encryption on top of their customencryption described in our former Patchwork blogpost. 
Defending against Confucius and Patchwork 
Threat actors like Confucius and Patchwork are known for their large arsenal of tools and ever-evolving techniques that can render traditional security solutions ― which are often not designed to handle the persistent and sophisticated threats detailed in this blog ― ineffective. To help combat these kinds of threats organizations will need to take a more proactive and focused security posture that can cover the most ground in terms of security. Some specific security measures organizations can implement: Recognize social engineering attempts. Malicious mobile apps are common infection vectors for cybercriminals, as they can attract specific target audiences. In this case, Confucius went with the common adage “sexsells” 

Proactively monitor the organization’s network. Threat actors are notorious for creating stealthy malware that can bypass superficial network monitoring. A more proactive stance that includes proper application of firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems can help mitigate the impact of an attack 
Implement network segmentation. Even with the best security technology, there is still a chance of an attack slipping through. Separating the network into individual parts, as well as restricting access to only those who really need it, can mitigate the damage that occurs in case of a successful attack. 
Update systems regularly. Everything fromendpoints to network software to IoT devices should be patched and updated to prevent or minimize the chance of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability 
In an ideal scenario, an organization’s in-house security teamimplement all of these and other security measures. The reality is that IT departments of small to large-sized organizations are not equipped to handle the more advanced threats that groups like Confucius use in their attacks. Since these teams also handle the day-to-day IT requirements of the organization, taking on a more involved and proactive stance may not be easy. In this case, an organization can look into third party security providers who can handle specialized work, such as root cause analysis and detailed research, and also provide a remediation plan that gives organizations a better chance against advanced threats.
