The McAfee. Advanced Threat Research team and McAfee Labs Malware Operations Group, employing McAfee. Global Threat Intelligence, have discovered a new global campaign targeting nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies. This campaign, Operation Sharpshooter, leverages an in-memory implant to download and retrieve a second-stage implant¡ªwhich we call Rising Sun¡ªfor further exploitation. According to our analysis, the Rising Sun implant uses source code from the Lazarus Group¡¯s 2015 backdoor Trojan 
Duuzer in a new framework to infiltrate these key industries.

Campaign Analysis 
This operation began October 25. A series of malicious documents carried the author¡¯s name Richard. These documents contained Korean-language metadata, indicating they were created with a Korean version of Microsoft Word. All the malicious documents had English-language job description titles for positions at 
unknown companies, distributed by an IP address in 
the United States and through the Dropbox service. The documents contained a malicious macro that leveraged 
embedded shellcode to inject the Sharpshooter 
downloader into the memory of Word. Once the Word 
process was infected, the downloader retrieved the 
second-stage implant Rising Sun. 
The shellcode of the downloader is 3.1KB in size and 
retrieved another implant hosted at 
hxxps://www.kingkoil.com.sg/query.php.

Shellcode behavior 
The shellcode executed by the Visual Basic for Applications macro in winword.exe acts as a simple downloader for the second-stage implant. The shellcode takes four steps to infect the endpoint with the second-stage payload: 
1. It builds Library and API names by populating string arrays using hardcoded bytes. (String construction is done 1 byte at a time.) This technique is used for constructing all strings in the shellcode, including the control server information. 

2. It resolves the Libraries and APIs using LoadLibraryA(), GetProcAddress(): 
¡ô 
urlmon.dll 
¡ô 
shfolder.dll 
¡ô 
ntdll.dll 
¡ô 
kernel32.dll 
¡ô

¡ô 
LoadLibraryA 
¡ô

¡ô

¡ô 
SHGetFolderPathA 
¡ô 
strcpy 
¡ô 
strcat 
¡ô 
CreateProcessA 
¡ô 
memset 
¡ô 
ShellExecuteA 
3. The implant downloads two files from its control 
server: 
¡ô 
Second-stage payload: The second-stage binary 
is downloaded from 
https://www[dot]kingkoil.com.sg/query.php 
to the startup folder on the endpoint: 
%Startup%\mssync.exe 
This step ensures persistence on the system for 
the second-stage implant as part of the download process, thereby removing the need for the second-stage implant to set up persistence for itself.

¡ô 
Second OLE (Word) document: Another OLE 
document is downloaded from 
https://www[dot]kingkoil.com.sg/ Strategic Planning Manager.doc 
to: 
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Strategic Planning Manager.doc 
This document is probably benign, used as a decoy to hide the malicious content. 

Figure 4. The decoy document downloaded from the control server.

¡ô 
The second-stage implant is executed using the 
CreateProcessA() API. 
¡ô 
The decoy document is opened using the 
ShellExecuteA() with the ¡°open¡± verb. 

The Advanced Threat Research team discovered another PDF document (10mins.PDF) by the same author. It appears to be a smart phone¨Crelated questionnaire. 
This document was hosted on the same server as the 
two job-related malicious documents. The questionnaire appears to come from a big data analytics company that specializes in antifraud protection and financial compliance.

Rising Sun behavior 
The Rising Sun implant is a fully functional modular 
backdoor that performs reconnaissance on the victim¡¯s 
network. 
Imports 
This implant starts by building its imports via dynamic API resolution: LoadLibrary()/GetProcAddress(). The library and API names are hardcoded as DWORD/WORD values in the implant and comprise a blob of bytes 0x147 bytes in size. This blob of data is decrypted using a simple single-byte XOR scheme with the key 0xC8. 
This scheme used for building the Library and API names is a variant of the byte-chunk string-construction technique often used by Lazarus implants. The scheme 
typically involves: 
¡ö 
Hardcoded library and API names in the form of DWORD/WORD/byte chunks in the implant. 
¡ö 
Assigning variables with these hardcoded values during the execution of the implant. 
¡ö 
Constructing character arrays that consist of the library and API names to be resolved. 
¡ö 
Optionally these arrays may have to be decoded using something as simple as a single-byte XOR decoding scheme. 
¡ö 
Using LoadLibrary()/GetProcAddress() to now resolve the libraries and APIs using the constructed name arrays. 

Figure 7. XOR-encoded library and API names in the implant. 
Configuration data 
The configuration data used by the implant is encrypted using an RC4 stream algorithm. The implant decrypts the configuration data at runtime and for communicating with the control server. The addresses decrypted from 
the implant: 
¡ö 
http://34[dot]214.99.20/view_style.php 
¡ö 
http://137[dot]74.41.56/board.php 
¡ö 
https://www[dot]kingkoil.com.sg/board.php 

Figure 8. The RC4 stream encryption algorithm used to decode the implant¡¯s configuration data. 



Initial reconnaissance 
The implant fetches the following data from the endpoint and exfiltrates it to the control server: 
¡ö 
Network adapter info 
¡ö 
Computer name 
¡ö 
User name 
¡ö 
IP address information 
¡ö 
Native system information 
¡ö 
OS product name from registry: 
SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\Windows NT\ CurrentVersion | ProductName 
Additional configuration 
The implant decrypts additional information during the 
reconnaissance process: 
VboxHook.dll tmp SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion ProductName RUNAS; RUN; DLL; winsta0\default Kernel32.dll lnk SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Run C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\ iexplore exe ntuser LOG8 
This configuration data is not completely used by the implant, but there is a high possibility of other variants of the implant using the complete configuration data. The configuration data may have been copied from another implant family without scrubbing unused strings from the data. 


Data encryption and exfiltration 
The implant carries out data encryption and exfiltration using the following steps: 
¡ö 
Once the data has been gathered from the endpoint, 
the implant encrypts it using the RC4 stream 
encryption algorithm. 
¡ö 
After the data has been encrypted, the implant 
performs another layer of obfuscation of the data by 
Base64-encoding the RC4 encrypted data. 
The implant performs an HTTP POST request to the 
control server: 
¡ö 
https://www[dot]kingkoil.com.sg/board.php 
As part of the request, the implant sends data in one of the following formats: 
¡ö 
boardID=<random_number>&page=<request_ type>&wr_id=<encoded_time_stamp>&session_ id=<RC4+base64 encoded data> 
¡ö 
bo_table=<random_number>&page=<request_ type>&wr_id=<encoded_time_stamp>&session_ id=<RC4+base64 encoded data> 
¡ö 
no=<random_number>&page=<request_ type>&wr_id=<encoded_time_stamp>&session_ id=<RC4+base64 encoded data> 
The first variable in the HTTP data can be any of the following (randomly selected) values: 
var1_enum = { ¡°code=¡± ¡°no=¡± ¡°bo_table=¡± ¡°boardID=¡± ¡°pageKey=¡± ¡°structureid=¡± } 
The <request_type> can be one of the following values: 
request_type= { ¡°free¡± //indicates initial reconnaissance data 
¡°query¡± //indicates a request to fetch the command ID from the control server 
¡°suggestion¡± //indicates request to fetch additional data from the control server 
¡°result¡± //indicates data obtained from a command¡¯s execution } 



Implant capabilities 
The implant carries 14 backdoor capabilities. It receives a command code (along with supporting data for the command) from the control server to execute a specific function. Unless otherwise specified, the implant sends 
the output of an executed command to the control server 
as an HTTP POST request with optional data in the form:

Attribution 
Attributing an attack to any threat group is often riddled with challenges, including potential ¡°false flag¡± operations by other threat actors. Technical evidence alone is not sufficient to attribute this activity with high confidence. However, based on our analysis, this operation shares multiple striking similarities with other 
the Lazarus Group attacks; thus we present them for 
further analysis. Although these similarities point to 
Lazarus, we also must consider the possibility of false 
flags. 
¡ö 
The malicious Word documents were created in a Korean-language environment. (The code page is in Korean.) 
¡ö 
The implant uses a variant of the dynamic API resolution technique we have observed with multiple Lazarus implants. 
¡ö 
The operation is very similar to a Lazarus operation 
from 2017 that targeted the US defense and energy sectors. The techniques, tactics, and procedures match those in this previous operation. 
¡ö 
Rising Sun is an evolution of the Lazarus backdoor Duuzer, which was circulated in 2015 and targeted South Korea. 

Comparing Rising Sun to Duuzer 
The Advanced Threat Research team found that Rising Sun shares code with the Duuzer implant family, which was identified by the security community as belonging to Lazarus. We compared the following samples and detail their similarities and differences. 
Samples used for comparison: 
¡ö 
Rising Sun: f3bd9e1c01f2145eb475a98c87f94a25 
¡ö 
Duuzer: 73471f41319468ab207b8d5b33b0b4be 
Configuration data 
Although the decryption schemes used by Rising Sun and Duuzer are different, both implants use similar configuration data used to drive their reconnaissance 
capabilities: 


Configuration data 
decoded by Duuzer 
VboxHook.dll tmp SOFTWARE\ Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion ProductName RUNAS; RUN; DLL; winsta0\ default Kernel32. dll lnk SOFTWARE\ Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Run perfd000 dat 
Configuration data 
decoded by Rising Sun 
VboxHook.dll tmp SOFTWARE\ Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion ProductName RUNAS; RUN; DLL; winsta0\ default Kernel32. dll lnk SOFTWARE\ Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Run C:\Program Files\ Internet Explorer\ iexplore exe ntuser LOG8 



Library/API resolution 
Both implants use the same technique of constructing and decoding library and API names for dynamic API resolution. We explained this technique (a variant of byte-chunk library/API name construction) in a preceding section. Although the encoded data blob consisting of the library/API strings in Duuzer is 0x181 bytes in size and is decoded using 0x30 as the XOR key, the encoded data blob in Rising Sun is 0x147 bytes in size and is decoded using 0xC8 as the XOR key. 



Library names 
Another similarity between the two implant families 
is that some of the decoded library names consist of 
randomized characters. For example, Duuzer capitalizes random characters of the following library name: 
¡ö 
uSEr32.dlL 
Rising Sun does something similar in these library 
names: 
¡ö 
vErsIon.dll 
¡ö 
advapI32.dLL 



Similarities between Rising Sun and Duuzer 
The implant families are a direct match in several 
capabilities as well as in the code structure and API use to implement these capabilities. The following 
capabilities are a direct match: 

Initial reconnaissance (gather preliminary system info) 
Both implants capture the same information from the endpoint during their initial reconnaissance. The order of information and the API/code signatures are an exact match. 
Information captured by both implants: 
¡ö 
Network adapter info 
¡ö 
Computer name 
¡ö 
User name 
¡ö 
IP address information 
¡ö 
Native system information 
¡ö 
OS product name from registry: 
SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\Windows NT\ 
CurrentVersion | ProductName 


Capability #1: Execute commands 
Both implants can execute commands using cmd.exe with the output redirected to a temp file on the 
endpoint: 
¡ö 
cmd.exe /c ¡°<command> > <%temp%>\<Temp_ 
File_Prefix><random>.tmp¡± 2>&1 
Both implants support changing directories natively, without having to execute cd commands through the shell. Supported cd commands: 
¡ö 
cd <directory_path> 
¡ö 
cd. 
¡ö 
cd\ 




Capability #2: Get drive information 
Both implants gather the same data using similar code signatures: 
¡ö 
Drive type 
¡ö 
Total number of bytes on disk 
¡ö 
Total number of free bytes on disk 
¡ö 
Name of a specified volume 

Capability #4: Get processes information 
Both implants exfiltrate the exact same process 
information: 
¡ö 
Process name 
¡ö 
Process creation time 
¡ö 
Process exit time 
¡ö 
Process kernel mode time 
¡ö 
Process user mode time 

Figure 22. Duuzer¡¯s (at left) and Rising Sun¡¯s process time information gathering code signatures. 
Capability #5: Terminate process 
Both implants support the capability to terminate a process running on the system based on either the: 
¡ö 
Process Name 
¡ö 
Process ID 

Capability #6: Get file times 
Both implants implement the same capabilities: 
¡ö 
Find files based on a filename search string (for example, *.* or *.txt) 
¡ö 
For each file found, get the following times: . File creation time . Last access time (including read, write, or execute 
operations) 

Capability #7: Read a file 
Both implants can read the contents of a file specified by the control server and exfiltrate the contents of the file. 
Capability #8: Clear process memory 
There are no significant similarities between the two implants. 
Capability #9: Write a file to disk 
Both implants can write content served by the control server to a file on disk (with file path also specified by the control server) using the same sequence of actions: 
¡ö 
Get a file path from the control server and create a file corresponding to the file path. 
¡ö 
Fetch content to be written to the file from the control server using the implant-specific communication mechanism. 
¡ö 
Once the content has been written to the file path, 
send either a success or a failure response to the 
control server. 
Capability #10: Delete file 
Both implants can delete a file specified by the control server if it is not a directory. 


Capability #11: Get additional file information for files 
in a directory 
Both implants have the same capability to get file information for files in a specified directory, including the following data: 
¡ö 
File attributes 
¡ö 
File size 
¡ö 
File creation time 
¡ö 
Last access time 
¡ö 
File write time 
¡ö 
MZ compile time 

Capability #12: Connect to an IP address 
Both implants test connections to a specified IP address using the same actions, APIs, and code signatures: 
¡ö 
Test a connection to a specified network IP address 
over a specified port number. 
¡ö 
Only attempt to connect to the network address. 
¡ö 
Based on the connection attempt, send either a 
success or a failure response to the control server. 
Capability #13: Change file attributes 
Both implants can modify the same file attributes: 
¡ö 
File attributes (hidden, system, etc.) 
¡ö 
If the file is an MZ, then the compile time stamp of the file is also modified in the PE header. 


Differences between Rising Sun and Duuzer 
There are some notable differences in implementation between the two families. 
Communication mechanism: Duuzer uses a simple socket-based communication mechanism to send and receive data from its control server. Rising Sun uses an HTTP-based mechanism. This difference may be an enhancement by the attackers because masking the control server communication is more effective against 
detection by the human eye and network intrusion 
prevention systems. High-level differences in the 
communication mechanisms: 
¡ö 
Communication schemes (native socket vs. HTTP). 
¡ö 
Command codes used to indicate a specific capability 
¡ö 
Return codes/data indicating success or failure of a 
command¡¯s execution 
Encoding schemes: Apart from the library and API name construction and decoding, the encryption schemes used in the implant are quite different. While Duuzer uses a custom XOR scheme to decode its configuration data, Rising Sun uses the RC4 stream algorithm. 
Conclusion 
Our discovery of a new, high-function implant is another example of how targeted attacks attempt to gain intelligence. The malware moves in several steps. 
The initial attack vector is a document that contains a 
weaponized macro to download the next stage, which runs in memory and gathers intelligence. The victim¡¯s data is sent to a control server for monitoring by the actors, who then determine the next steps. 
We have not previously observed this implant. Based 
on our telemetry, we discovered that multiple victims 
from different industry sectors around the world have reported these indicators. Operation Sharpshooter¡¯s similarities to Lazarus Group malware are striking, but that does not ensure attribution. Was this attack just a first-stage reconnaissance operation, or will there be more? We will continue to monitor this campaign and 
will report further when we or others in the security 
industry receive more information. The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team encourages our peers to share their insights and attribution of who is responsible for Operation Sharpshooter.
