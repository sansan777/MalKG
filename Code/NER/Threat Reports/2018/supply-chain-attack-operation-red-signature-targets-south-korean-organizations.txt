Figure 1. Operation Red Signature¡¯s attack chain 
Here¡¯s howOperation Red Signature works: 
1. 
The code-signing certificate from the remote support solutions provider is stolen. It¡¯s possible that the certificate was stolen as early as April 2018, as we found a ShiftDoor malware (4ae4aed210f2b4f75bdb855f6a5c11e625d56de2) on April 8 that was signed with the stolen certificate. 

2. 
Malicious update files are prepared, signed with the stolen certificate, and uploaded to the attacker¡¯s server (207[.]148[.]94[.]157). 

3. 
The update server of the company is hacked. 

4. 
The update server is configured to receive an update.zip file fromthe attackers¡¯ server if a client is connecting froma specific range of IP addresses belonging to their targeted organizations. 

5. 
The malicious update.zip file is sent to the client when the remote support programis executed. 

6. 
The remote supportprogramrecognizes the update files as normal and executes the 9002 RAT malware inside it. 

7. 
9002RATdownloads and executes additional malicious files fromthe attackers¡¯ server. 


YouremailhereSubscribeWebpageconvertedtoPDFwiththePDFmyURLPDFcreationAPI!Technical analysis 
The update.zip file contains an update.ini file, which has the malicious update configuration that specifies the remote support solution programto download file000.zip and file001.zip and extract themas rcview40u.dll and rcview.log to the installation folder. 
The programwill then execute rcview40u.dll, signed with the stolen certificate, with Microsoft register server (regsvr32.exe). This dynamic-link library (DLL) is responsible for decrypting the encrypted rcview.log file and executing it in memory. 9002 RAT is the decrypted rcview.log payload, which connects to the command-and-control (C&C) server at 66[.]42[.]37[.]101.

Correlating 9002 RAT 
Delving into 9002 RAT, we found that it was compiled on July 17, 2018, and that the configuration files inside update.zip were created on July 18. Our analysis of an update log file we found reveals the remote support program¡¯s update process started around 13:35 on July 18, with the 9002 RAT being downloaded and launched. We also sawthe RAT file used for this specific attack was set to be inactive in August, so we can construe that the RAT¡¯s activity was rather short-lived (fromJuly 18 to July 31).

Additional malware tools 
The 9002 RAT also serves as a springboard for delivering additional malware. Most of these are downloaded as files compressed with the Microsoft cabinet format (.cab). This is most likely done to avoid detection by antivirus (AV) solutions. 
Here¡¯s a list of files that 9002 RAT retrieves and delivers to the affected system: 
Filename  Tool  Purpose  
dsget.exe  DsGet  Viewactive directory objects  
dsquery.exe  DsQuery  Search for active directory objects  
sharphound.ex e  SharpHound  Collect active directory information

And when stacked up with regulations such as the EUGeneral Data Protection and Regulation (GDPR), the impact can be exacerbated. 
Here are some best practices: 
Oversee third-party products and services; apart fromensuring the security of the organization¡¯s own online premises (e.g., patching, authentication mechanisms), security controls must also be in place in third-party applications being used. 
Develop a proactive incident response strategy: Supply chain attacks are often targeted; organizations must be able to fully understand, manage, and monitor the risks involved in third-party vendors. 
Proactively monitor the network for anomalous activities; firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems help mitigate network-based threats. 
Enforce the principle of least privilege: Network segmentation, data categorization, restriction of systemadministration tools, and application control help deter lateral movement and minimize data being exposed.
