Background 
Recently, 360 Threat Intelligence Center is investigating one email phishing attack which is targeting one Pakistani businessman who is working in China. First attack of this campaign took place in May 2018. Attackers have taken over of target machines over months. TTP of this targeting attack will be introduced, as well as remediation advice. 
We identi.ed this APT group coded as ‘APT-C-35’ in 2017, who is mainly targeting Pakistan and other South Asian countries for cyber espionage[1]. Arbor also published APT research on this group, and named it ‘Donot’[2]. The group attacked government agencies, aiming for classi.ed intelligence. At least 4 attack campaigns against Pakistan have been observed by us since 2017. Spear phishing emails with vulnerable Of.ce documents or malicious macros are sent to victims. Two unique malware frameworks, EHDevel and yty, are developed by attackers. In the latest attack, Donot group is targeting Pakistani businessman working in China. 

Fishing Attack 
The process of attacking target is as following: 


Malware Analysis 
Dropper -Excel Macros 
Attackers lure victim to open decoy Excel .le with malicious macro which is sent as attachment in a phishing email. While macro code is running, of.ce_update.exe is dropped at C:\micro and run. The decoy Excel document pretends to be pricing list of one BMW car, which is easy to have trust of the victim: 

Downloader -of.ce_update. exe 
.lename of.ce_update.exe 
MD5 2320ca79f627232979314c974e602d3a 
Of.ce_updata.exe is a downloader, which is able to download a BAT .le by http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/pushBatch: 

The BAT .le is mainly to modify registry for persistence, and create a directory with hidden property, etc. It can also download wlidsvcc.exe from http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/pushAgent, then save it in %USERPROFILE%\BackCon.g\BackUp directory: 

After that, Of.ce_updata.exe will remove itself from system. 


Plugin -Downloader -wlidsvcc.exe 
Filename wlidsvcc.exe MD5 68e8c2314c2b1c43709269acd7c8726c 
https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 
Wlidsvcc.exe is also a downloader. It downloads 3 plugins from C2 server, naming wuaupdt.exe, kylgr.exe, and svchots.exe. Mutex "wlidsvcc" is created to ensure that only one instance runs in system: 

Then, it determines if the current process path is %USERPROFILE%BackCon.g\BackUp\wlidsvcc.exe: 

If the path meets condition, wlidsvcc.exe communicates with C2 (bigdata.akamaihub.stream) by POST, which is to retrieve remote commands 

If C2 sends ‘no’ command, wlidsvcc.exe will retry to contact C2 after sleeping for 90 seconds: 

If ‘cmdline’ command is received, wlidsvcc.exe runs plug-in %USERPROFILE%\BackCon.g\BackUp\wuaupdt.exe, and then listens for follow-up commands: If commands are neither ‘no’ nor ‘cmdline’, wlidsvcc.exe downloads http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/orderMe to C:\Users\%s\BackCon.g\BigData, then puts itself into waiting mode: 



Plugin executor -wuaupdt.exe 
Filename Wuaupdt.exe MD5 35ec92dbd07f1ca38ec2ed4c4893f7ed 
wuaupdt.exe is a CMD backdoor, which can receive and execute CMD commands sent from C2. It can also execute other plugins if commands are issued by attackers. The analysis of all backdoor plugins is shown in the following section. 
Execute C2 commands: 


Backdoor -Plugins 
wuaupdt.exe will execute corresponding plug-ins according to the commands issued by attackers. All plugins’ details are as following. 
Keylogger -Kylgr.exe 
Filename Kylgr.exe 
MD5 88f244356fdaddd5087475968d9ac9bf PDB path c:\users\user\documents\visualstudio2010\Projects\newkeylogger\Release\new keylogger.pdb 
https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/ 
This plugin is a keylogger. It .rstly creates a .le inc3++.txt in current directory and check whether a keylogging .le exists in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood directory. If yes, it saves log .le name and its last modi.cation time to inc3++.txt: 

If keylogging .le is found in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood, the log .le is moved to directory %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood\Spools: 

A new keylogging .le is created in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood, with .lename ‘username_year_month_day(hour_minute_second)’. Then, it monitors activities of mouse and keyboard constantly. 

If window name is obtained, the name and pressed keys are logged: 

File -listing -svchots.exe 
Filename svchots.exe 
MD5 14eda0837105510da8beba4430615bce 
This plugin traverses disk C, D, E, F, G and H to collect .lenames: 

Following directories are excluded: 

The, .les with following extensions are collected: 

If .les matching above criteria are found, .le names and last modi.cation date of them are written into test.txt .le in the current directory, and they are copied to %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Spools directory, with appending ‘txt’ as new extension name: 

Systeminfo C spsvc.exe 
Filename Spsvc.exe 
MD5 2565215d2bd8b76b4bff00cd52ca81be 
This plugin, packed by UPX and written by Go Language, aims to collect various system information. It creates several CMD processes for information collection. Information is saved to a .le located in directory %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Spools: 

Uploader C lssm.exe 
Filename Lssm.exe 
Md5 23386af8fd04c25dcc4fdbbeed68f8d4 
The purpose of this plugin is to upload collected information and .les, stored in %USERPROFILE%Printers\Spools directory, to C2 bigdata.akamaihub.stream 

Uploader C lssmp.exe 
Filename lssmp.exe 
MD5 b47386657563c4be9cec0c2f2c5f2f55 
Digital signature COMODO CA Limited 
Similar to lssm.exe, lssmp.exe uploads collected info and .les to C2. It has a digital signature: 

The plugin searches for explorer.exe in process list: 

Then, it extracted out a PE .le from its resource section: 

The PE .le is injected into explorer.exe process for running: 

The injected PE .le has similar functionalities as lssm.exe, since it uploads keystroke log to C2 server: 



Pivoting 
Some other decoy documents and plugins are found to have connections with the .les in this attack. 
CSD_Promotion_Scheme_2018. XLS 
Filename CSD_Promotion_Scheme_2018. XLS MD5 82a5b24fddc40006396f5e1e453dc256 
The decoy document is an Excel .le with malicious macros. When it is opened, a window of Excel security disclamation pop up, warning user that this .le has risky macros: The main function of malicious macro code is to drop skypet.exe in the directory %APPDATA%, and to drop skype.bat in the directory C:\Skype. skypet.bat is executed after that: 


Same pricing list of a BMW car is content of the Excel .le: 


Skyep.bat 
Skyep.bat creates 3 directories %USERPROFILE%Printers\Spools, %USERPROFILE%BackCon.g\BackUp and %USERPROFILE%BackCon.g\BigData , and then sets these folder properties to hidden: 

The BAT .le also gets the computer name, and save it into %USERPROFILE%\BackCon.g\Backup\pcap.txt: 

And it creates multiple registry entries for persistence. Then, it starts skyep.exe and deletes itself: 


Skyep.exe 
File\Skyep.exe name 
MD5 f67595d5176de241538c03be83d8d9a1 
PDB C:\Users\spartan\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\downloader new 22 jun use\downloader\Release\downloader.pdb 
Skyep.exe, disguising as a voice software Skype, downloads csrsses.exe from http://databig.akamaihub.stream/pushBatch (it is still alive) to the \BackCon.g\BackUp\ for running: 


Csrsses.exe 
The .le name Csrsses.exe. MD5 e0c0148ca11f988f292f527733e54fca 
This .le, similar to wlidsvcc.exe, is to execute commands from C2 server. Firstly, it reads computer name from \\BackCon.g\\BackUp\\pcap.txt 

The computer name is then processed to a string: "orderme/computer name -random number". It contacts C2 databig.akamaihub.stream for commands: 

It check value of Content-Type to determine next operation. If the value is "application", it downloads .le from C2 to \\BackCon.g\\BigData\\ directory: 

If the value is "cmdline", \\BackCon.g\\BigData\\wuaupdt.exe is executed: 

If command is"batcmd", \\BackCon.g\\BigData\\test.bat is started: 



Attribution --Donot (APT-C-35) 
By analyzing the macro code, plugins, domain name /IP correlation in the attack, we con.rm that Donot APT Group (APT-C-35) is behind the attack. 
Similarity of Macro Code 
ASERT disclosed one macro sample linking to DONOT APT Group in March 2018[2]. That macro sample is very similar to the sample in this attack: a decoy picture is pop up after macro runs. 


Similarity of Plug-ins 
Similar to previous Donot samples, new sample downloads plugins from C2. It is also packed by UPX and is written in Go language. Furthermore, it has similar code logic as previous ones 

wuaupdt.exe in this attack appears in previous Donot attack[1], and C2 addresses are same to previous ones. 


Conclusion 
From the attack activity captured this time, it is obvious that Donot APT group is still keen on Pakistan as primary target of attack, and even expands scope of attack to include Pakistani staffs and institutions in China. There is a sign that the Donot group has never stopped its attacks and another cyber espionage attack could be launched soon. 
360 Threat Intelligence Center suggests enterprises to improve employees' security awareness by provide them suf.cient security training, especially anti-phishing training. Situational awareness, asset management, and threat intelligence can prevent such attacks signi.cantly. 
For 360 ESG customers, detection to Donot group and related IOCs are supported by products integrated with threat intelligence, including 360 Threat Intelligence Platform, SkyEye Advance Threat Detection System, 360 NGSOC.
