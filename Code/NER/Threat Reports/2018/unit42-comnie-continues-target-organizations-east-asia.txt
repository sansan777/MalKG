Unit 42 has been tracking a series of attacks using a remote backdoor malware family named Comnie, which have beenobserved targeting organizations in the East Asia region. Comnie, .rst named by Sophos seemingly after the Windows LNK.le name it created, is a custom malware family that is used in targeted attacks, and has been observed in the wild since atleast April 2013. The Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages online blogs and third-party services to obtaincommand and control (C2) information. Recent instances of the malware have been observed leveraging github.com, tumbler.com, and blogspot.com. 
Attackers using Comnie are leveraging malicious macros that initially hide decoy documents and shows them when thevictim enables macros. These decoys documents pertain to various subject matters that the targets would be likely to beinterested in. The contents of these documents suggest that the main interests of threat actor likely included theorganizations in the following industries, located in Taiwan: 

Telecommunication Defense Government 



High Tech 
The most recent attacks, in November 2017, likely targeted organizations in the following industries, located in South Korea: 

Aerospace Defense 

Additionally, while researching this campaign, we identi.ed historical attacks that appear to target the Taiwan government,an IT service vendor based in Asia, and a journalist of a Tibetan radio station. 
Activities Involving Comnie 
Beginning in mid of 2015, we observed the Comnie malware family delivered via malicious macros with various .le namesand decoy subject matters. Original .le names, as well as information revealed within the decoy documents used by thesesamples provide clues as to who the targets may be. In the most recent attacks in November 2017, the information suggests that these attacks have most likely taken place against Aerospace and Defense industry targets in South Korea. 
Original File Name  Translation  Decoy  Location  Most Likely Target

PBCS_ .. _.. _. ..doc  PBCS_related_status_report.doc  Report on the status of Performance-Based Communication and Surveillance (PBCS)  KR  Aerospace Defense  

The following decoy contents are only shown to the victim after macros have been enabled:

Before the attacks against South Korean targets, the same malicious macros were used to deliver the Comnie malwarefamily to targets in Taiwan as early as 2015. Again, based on the original .le names and the decoy contents, the mostcommonly witnessed targets in attacks that occurred in 2017 included those involving the Telecommunication, Defense, andHigh-Tech industries in Taiwan.

It is worth noting that in the attack that made use of the decoy document in Figure 4, the attacker also included related.rewall logs and appears to have originated from a compromised an IT service vendor. 
Looking at earlier attacks between 2013 and 2016, we believe Comnie was also used in targeted attacks against thefollowing individuals or organizations: 

Taiwan 
government 


IT 
service vendor in Asia 


Journalist 
of a Tibetan radio station

Malicious Macros 
The malicious macro documents used to deliver Comnie initially hide the content inside and requests that the user enablesmacros prior to viewing the document. Once the user enables macros, the macro will perform the following actions: 
1. 
Displays decoy content 

2. 
Checks for the existence of a .le at %APPDATA%.wscript.exe 

3. 
If %APPDATA%.wscript.exe does not exist, the macro converts an embedded hex-encoded string into bytes and saves this data to the %APPDATA%.wscript.exe. 

4. 
Executes the newly created wscript.exe payload 



Figure 7 Example macro used to delivery Comnie 
An interesting discovery was made when examining the macros used to deliver Comnie. Based on evidence gleaned fromboth the macro and other data collected from the samples, it appears that the threat actor did not generate thesedocuments from scratch. Instead, they appear to have been created based on an existing sample available via publicsample repositories. The existing sample in question was created by a red team penetration tester at a .nancial institutionfor internal testing. The following image shows a comparison of macro code extracted from Comnie dropper and .nancialinstitution’s penetration test sample.

Comnie Malware Family 
Comnie uses the RC4 algorithm in multiple locations both to obfuscate strings used by the malware, as well as for networkcommunication. Additionally, the malware looks for multiple security products on victim machines and sometimes alters itsbehavior depending on the products present. More information about how Comnie handles identi.ed security products may be 
found 
in 
the 
technical 
analysis 
in 
the 
Appendix. 
These security products included those that are known to be most widely used within South Korea and Taiwan. 
Comnie is able to achieve persistence via a .lnk .le that is stored within the victim’s startup path. When originally run,Comnie will convert itself from an executable .le to a DLL and will write this newly created DLL to the host machine’s%APPDATA% directory. The built-in Windows utility rundll32.exe is then used to load this DLL by the original .lnk .le. 
Unit 42 has observed a total of two variants of Comnie. One of the ways the variants di.er is in how they obtain their command and control (C2) information. Both variants make use of third-party online services in an attempt to prevent DNSbased blocking of their .rst stage communications. However, the obfuscation mechanism varies slightly. In older variants, Comnie was found to look for the ‘++a++’ markers. The example C2s used by older variants of Comnie demonstrates this:

that 
may be 
used 
to

C2 
information 
from 
the 
older 
Comnie 
variants. 

Newer Comnie variants, such as the ones witnessed in the most recent attacks, instead look for the ‘magnet:/’ and ‘?’ markers, such as in the following recent example: 

After Comnie collects the remote C2 information, it will communicate with these remote servers using HTTP requests. Theserequests are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. Comnie will upload information about the victim. It also allows the attacker to provide and subsequently execute a batch script (BAT), executable .le (EXE), or dynamic-link library (DLL). 
More detailed information about how C2 information is decoded and additional technical analysis of Comnie may be foundin the Appendix. 

Conclusion 
Comnie is far from a new threat, however, it continues to remain active. In the past year, we have observed multiple low volume attacks in various regions of East Asia. Based on clues provided by the malware’s original .le names, as well as thedecoy content embedded within these samples, we can make a reasonable estimation that these attacks targetedorganizations in Taiwan in the Telecommunication, Defense, Government, and High-Tech industries. Additionally, those sameestimations may be made for attacks in South Korea targeting the Aerospace and Defense industries. 
While we have witnessed modi.cations to the attacker’s toolsets, the overall architecture and operations of the Comniemalware family have remained consistent, suggesting that the attackers have been able to stay below the radar of thesecurity community. 
The Comnie malware family is notable in that it leverages third-party online services to download and parse C2 information.Because these third-party online services are legitimate, it allows Comnie to circumvent a number of security preventionsthat 
may be 
present 
in 
the 
environment. 
This overall 
technique 
has previously been 
referred 
to 
as using 
a 
“Dead 
Drop 
Resolver” 
or 
DDR.

Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways: 
All identi.ed samples have been .agged as malicious by WildFire and Traps 
Customers may track this threat using the ‘Comnie’ AutoFocus tag 
Traps appropriately catches the macro execution from the malware and prevents it 
Additionally, blogspot, tumblr, and github have been alerted to the malicious activity discovered. 

Appendix 
Comnie Technical Analysis 
For the analysis of the Comnie malware family, we investigated the following sample: 

When the sample is initially executed, it will attempt to create a mutex with a name of ‘tmutexabc’ to ensure only a single instance of Comnie is running at a given time. Should this mutex already be found to exist, the malware will immediately exit. 
Comnie continues to load an embedded bitmap (BMP) .le and decrypt data at o.set 0x512. 

RC4 is used to decrypt this data using a 16-byte key that is stored within the BMP .le at o.set 0x502. Once decrypted, weare provided with a large list of strings, as seen below (note that the data has been truncated for brevity): 

After these strings are decrypted, the malware will load a series of Microsoft Windows API calls to be used later on. After these functions are loaded, Comnie determines if it is running within the %TEMP% directory of the victim machine. In the event it is not running within this directory, it will copy itself to %TEMP% and execute this newly created .le with anargument of the original .le’s path. A total of 64MB of garbage data is appended to this copied .le, likely as a way to deterany security products in place that may be scanning .les on disk. After running within the %TEMP% path, Comnie will delete the original .le. 
After Comnie has been copied to the %TEMP% directory, it will look for the presence of the ‘DQuit.tmp’ .le in this path. It is unclear how this .le is used exactly, as it does not appear to ever be written during runtime by Comnie. 
Comnie continue to enter its installation routine. In doing so, it will attempt to detect the following Anti-Virus products via various techniques: 

Trend Micro Kaspersky Symantec Avira AVG ALYac Ahnlab 






Ahnlab 
and 
ALYac 
are 
the 
most 
widely used 
Anti-Virus solutions in 
South 
Korea 
(http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2017102502101260041001), 
and 
Trend 
Micro 
and 
the 
rest 
are 
also 
known 
to 
be 
most 
widely used 
in 
Taiwan.These are in-line with the targeting of the victims witnessed by the attackers using Conmie. 
With a few exceptions, Comnie will perform the following actions regardless of what security product, if any, is discovered: 

Convert 
itself to a temporary DLL with a default export of ‘Dm’ in the %TEMP% directory. 


If 
running with administrator privileges on a 32-bit host: 



Copy the temporary DLL in %TEMP% to %WINDOWS%.LINKINFO.dll Otherwise: 


Copy 
the temporary DLL in %TEMP% to %APPDATA%.cnagnt.dll 


Delete 
the temporary DLL in %TEMP% 


Write 
a ‘Conime.lnk’ .le in the user’s startup path. This shortcut .le points to ‘C:.Windows.system32.rundll32.exe “%APPDATA%.cnagnt.dll”,Sd’ 


One of the exceptions to the installation routine above is in the event Symantec is detected. In such a scenario, Comnie will drop a temporary VBS script to write the ‘Conime.lnk’ .le. 
Additionally, in the event Kaspersky is detected, the malware will immediately run the ‘Conime.lnk’ shortcut .le in a new process after it is created. 
After the installation routine, the malware will decrypt an embedded blob of data using RC4 with an embedded 8-byte statickey of ‘.x11.xcc.xd1.x32.x61.x21.xd1.xe2’. The results of the decoded data may be seen below: 

The decrypted data contains URLs for various online services that will be used by the attacker for downloading data that willcontain the command and control (C2) server(s) and port(s) to be used by Comnie. 
Comnie will make requests to these URLs, looking for base64-encoded data after an identi.er of ‘magnet:/’, as seen in the example below: 

In the example above, the C2 information is being stored within the user’s URL parameter within GitHub. In order to decode this data, Comnie .rst decodes it using base64 with the following non-standard alphabet (note that it is simply the originalalphabet in reverse): 
/+9876543210zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA 
The resulting data is then parsed and decrypted using RC4. The .rst 64 bytes are used as the key. The next 4 bytes represent the underlying data’s length, and the remaining data is the C2 data. The prior example decrypts to the following: 
mailto:121.126.211[.]94:8080.80.80 
The following Python script may be used to decode the C2 data used by the newest Comnie variant: 
1 import base64 
2 import sys
3 import re 
4 from string import maketrans 
5 from struct import *

14 j = (j + S[i] + ord( key[i % len(key)] )) % 256 
15 S[i] , S[j] = S[j] , S[i]
16 i=j=0 
17 for char in data: 
18 i=(i+1)%256 
19 j=(j+S[i]) %256 
20 S[i] , S[j] = S[j] , S[i]
21 out.append(chr(ord(char) ^ S[(S[j] + S[i]) % 256])) 
22 return ''.join(out)

32 
33 def trans(string): 
34 return str(string).translate(base64fixTable)
35 
36 def altdecode(string): 
37 return base64.b64decode(trans(string)) 
38 
39 req = requests.get(sys.argv[1]) 
40 fd = req.text 
41 
42 original_data = re.search("magnet:/\?([^\?]+)\?", fd).group(1)
43 parsed_data = altdecode(original_data)
44 
45 dataLength = unpack("<I", parsed_data[64:68])[0]
46 key = decode(parsed_data[0:64]) 
47 data = parsed_data[dataLength*-1:]
48 
49 d = rc4_crypt(data, key)
50 
51 print(d) 
Comnie will make attempts at connecting to the IP address above using the various ports speci.ed. Data is sent via HTTP, and is encrypted against using the RC4 algorithm. The URIs used in the HTTP requests are randomly generated. Data is provided .rst via the ‘pid’ GET parameter initially, and via the ‘iid’ GET parameter when POST requests are made by Comnie. Initially, Comnie will send the following request: In order to decrypt the data provided within the ‘pid’ parameter, a key is generated using the SessionID information, which is randomly generated. This particular data is decoded from hex and bytes at o.sets 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 are used toform an 8-byte RC4 key. After applying this decryption algorithm, we are presented with the following data: 

h=HOSTNAME-PC&f=mission.ini&c=& 
The response made by the C2 server uses the same RC4 key for encryption. The data above contains the hostname (‘HOSTNAME-PC’) of the victim machine, as well as an instruction. In this case, the instruction is asking for information thatis to be written to a temporary BAT .le within the %TEMP% directory. The following example information is provided by the remote C2 server: 
1 [MISSION]2 Id=2017 3 Crc=201701 4 [BAT]5 Num=1 6 FileName1=gethostinfo.bat 7 Crc1=2017011 8 ResultFile1=info.dat 
This INI .le is parsed to determine what Comnie should do. Comnie allows the attacker to provide and subsequentlyexecute a batch script (BAT), executable .le (EXE), or dynamic-link library (DLL). Using this example, Comnie will then request data to supply to the BAT script, via the following decrypted request: 
h=HOSTNAME-PC&f=gethostinfo.bat&c=& 
Based on network tra.c witnessed, the remote C2 server was found to respond with the following information: 
1 netstat -ano > %TEMP%\info.dat 2 ipconfig /all >> %TEMP%\info.dat 3 route PRINT >> %TEMP%\info.dat 4 net view >> %TEMP%\info.dat 5 tasklist >> %TEMP%\info.dat 6 net user >> %TEMP%\info.dat 7 net start >> %TEMP%\info.dat 
This script is written to a temporary .le prior to be executed. The results of this BAT script are uploaded to the remote C2 server.
