Comment Crew. Oceansalt appears to have been part of an operation targeting South Korea, United States, and Canada in a well-focused attack. A variation of this malware has been distributed from two compromised sites in South Korea. (They are currently offline.) Oceansalt appears to be the first stage of an advanced persistent threat. The malware can send system data to a control server and execute commands on infected machines, but we do not yet know its ultimate purpose. The Advanced Threat Research team has not previously described this implant in any of our analyses.

altogether. Until this analysis, we had observed no 
indications that this is a new Comment Crew campaign, it 

raises the question of who is responsible. Based on our research, we offer a few potential scenarios that could 
explain the existence of Comment Crew¡¯s code in the current actor¡¯s malware targeting South Koreans. 
¡ö 
This is a code-sharing arrangement between two 
actors 
¡ö 
An actor has privately gained access to the source 
code from someone involved in the original Comment 
Crew operations 
¡ö 
This is a ¡°false flag¡± operation using Comment Crew¡¯s 
code to make it appear that China and North Korea 
have collaborated on this cyberattack 
Does the Actor Speak Korean? 
The contents of the malicious documents were written in 
Korean and contained subjects specifically relating to the finances of projects in South Korea. These documents appear to be unique, not found on open-source 
channels. We were not able to determine the source of these documents, suggesting they were created by the actor. 
The metadata in the malicious Microsoft Office 
documents used in the attacks contains a Korean-language code page. This data indicates the document contained the Korean-language pack, most likely to 
ensure the victims could read it. We also see a consistent author, which is typical of the techniques of previous campaigns we have analyzed that involved malicious 
documents targeting South Koreans. 

Figure 1. Metadata from a code page in a malicious .xls document. 
The Advanced Threat Research team concludes that we have found a new implant family created by an actor 
targeting Korean-speaking users and using components from Comment Crew¡¯s source code. Furthermore it is likely that the actor has a good working knowledge of the Korean language. 
Targets 
During our research we discovered the initial attack vector was spear phishing, with two malicious Korean-
language Microsoft Excel documents acting as downloaders of this implant. According to our document analysis, the targets likely had knowledge of South Korean public infrastructure projects and related 
financials¡ªa clear indication that the actor focused 
initially on infrastructure. 
A second round of malicious documents, this time in Microsoft Word, carried the same metadata and author as the Excel documents. The content was related to the 
financials of the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund. The malicious activity first appeared on May 31, 2018, in South Korea. Further telemetry indicates organizations outside of Korea have fallen victim to this attack; as of 

August 14, the attack had reached multiple industries in Canada and the United States. 
The date of the attack¡¯s first appearance in North America is unknown. We did not find Office documents affecting targets in Canada and the United States, but our telemetry indicates the threat has also affected systems in North America. It is possible the attack 
on North American companies is part of a separate campaign from the one targeting Koreans, especially 
because we discovered only a handful of malicious documents and they distributed only one variant of the implant out of several we found. Based on our telemetry, the team learned these organizations were in the investment, banking, and agriculture industries. 
Objectives and Impact 
Our research suggests the targets were those who would read documents related to South Korea¡¯s public 
construction expenses, Inter-Korean Cooperation fund, or other global financial data. One possible motive for the campaign is financial theft. These attacks might 
be a precursor to a much larger attack that could be 
devastating given the control the attackers have over their infected victims. The impact of these operations could be huge: Oceansalt gives the attackers full control 
of any system they manage to compromise and the network it is connected to. A bank¡¯s network would be 
an especially lucrative target. 
Further, the code overlaps with that from a previously reported advanced state-sponsored group. The overlap 
suggests a close collaboration between members of a state-sponsored group and the current actors in conducting cyber operations. 
Campaign Analysis 
The campaign to target and compromise victims across 
the world began in Korea and expanded globally in 
stages. The distribution URLs for the implants were fairly consistent for the malicious documents; it appears the 
actor hacked a number of South Korean websites to host the implant code. 
Wave One: South Korean higher education 
The first wave of attacks began with a malicious document created May 18, with a last saved date of May 
28. The author of this Korean-language document was Lion, whom we will continue to see throughout later 
documents. 


In the first wave the malicious Excel file contains a list of 
Korean names, physical addresses, and email addresses. 
Many of the names belong to those involved in higher education in South Korea or who attend various institutes. However, the list is random and looks like a 
copy of a database of personal information from a South 
Korean government authority. 
This document contains macro code to download the implant from www.[redacted].kr/admin/data/member/1/ 
log.php and execute it as V3UI.exe, the name of a 
security product in South Korea. 
Wave Two: South Korean public infrastructure 
The Advanced Threat Research team discovered that the 
implant was hosted at a legitimate site in South Korea 
belonging to a music teachers organization that has 
no relationship to the malicious document. The actor hosted a PHP page that triggered the download of the 
implant from a malicious VBA script embedded in two Excel documents, which contained Visual Basic macros 
to communicate, download, and install an implant on 
the victim¡¯s system once the document was opened and viewed. The documents were submitted to us by a South Korean organization during the first wave of attacks. 
hxxp://[redacted].kr/admin/data/member/1/log.php 
Figure 3. The download URL for the second wave of attacks, against public infrastructure. 
This Excel document was created May 31 by the author 
Lion, a day before the implant was compiled and hosted 
on the distribution site. The documents appear to be related to South Korean public infrastructure projects 
and their expenses. Based on our analysis of the 
documents, it is clear that this attack is targeted toward 
South Korean individuals in this field.

projects.

The last document in this wave was created by Lion on June 4 with the filename 0. ... _.. _SW_2018 . .._list_(20180411)_ .... .xls. This document was observed downloading the implant from the distribution server. It references Onnara, a government agency responsible for land and development in South Korea. 


Wave Three: Inter-Korean Cooperation 
The third wave included a Word document with the same type of macro code as the Excel files. The 
document contained fake information related to the 
financials of the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund. The 
document was created at the same time as the attacks 
on South Korean public infrastructure officials. Lion 
authored both Excel and Word documents. This Word 
document used a different South Korean compromised website to distribute the implant. In this wave, an 
additional Excel document appeared with telephone numbers and contact information connected to the content of the Word document.

Wave Four: Targets outside of South Korea 
We identified a small number of targets outside of 
South Korea, as the attacks expanding their scope. We 
have yet to identify the malicious documents involved in delivering this implant to the victims. Because Waves One and Two contained different distribution servers for the implant, we expect this wave had its own as well. 
According to McAfee telemetry data between August 10 
and 14, these North American targets fall within several 
industries:

Wave Five: South Korea and United States 
The Oceansalt implant was not limited to just one 
sample. We discovered additional variants using different control servers. As we continued to investigate, 
we found more samples, though obfuscated to 
avoid detection. The samples were all identical to the initial Oceansalt implant. The fifth-wave samples 
were compiled between June 13 and July 17 and were 
submitted to us by organizations in South Korea and the 
United States.

Control Server 
The campaign employed multiple control servers. We observed the following IP addresses in implants dating 
from June to July. 
¡ö 
172.81.132.62 
¡ö 
211.104.160.196 
¡ö 
27.102.112.179 
¡ö 
158.69.131.78 
Our telemetry shows this campaign is operational in 
several countries. Address 211.104.160.196 indicates infections in Costa Rica, the United States, and the Philippines. Address 158.69.131.78 reveals additional 
infections in the United States and Canada. 
These machines resided in numerous countries 
from August 18¨C21. Because this operation involves 
multifunction implants, these machines are likely to be 
part of a larger covert listener network. The Advanced Threat Research team has observed this kind of targeting in similar operations that compromise victims as control server relays. 
Implant Origins 
Our initial investigation into earlier similar samples led us to a variant¡ªbf4f5b4ff7ed9c7275496c07f9836028, 
compiled in 2010. Oceansalt uses portions of code from 
this sample; their overall similarity is 21%. The reused code is unique, is not considered a common library or common code, and serves reconnaissance and control. 
The misclassified sample used a Comment Crew domain. Further investigation revealed the misclassified sample is 99% like Seasalt (5e0df5b28a349d46ac8cc7d9e5e61a96), a Comment Crew implant reported to have been used in their 
operations around 2010. Thus the Oceansalt actor is reusing portions of code from Seasalt to form a new 
implant. Based on the overall techniques, Oceansalt is 
unlikely to signal a rebirth of Comment Crew, raising the 
question of how the actor obtained the Seasalt code. Was it provided to this or another actor, or was it leaked and discovered by this actor? We have been unable to find any evidence in underground or public forums that 
suggest the source code of Seasalt has been leaked or 
made available. 
We discovered another batch of samples compiled on July 16¨C17 that are obfuscated and essentially the 
same implant, with minor changes such as the control 
servers. Some of the samples are missing reverse-shell 
functionality, indicating that this actor has access to Seasalt source code and can compile implants from 
the original source. This could demonstrate is a level of 
collaboration between two nation-states on their cyber 
offensive programs. 
Code Similarities with Seasalt 
Oceansalt contains the following strings that are part of Seasalt: 
¡ö 
Upfileer 
¡ö 
Upfileok Both implants have a high degree of similarity in code 




sharing and functions. A few of their commonalities follow. 
Command handler and index table similarities 
The command handler for both implants uses similar semantics and command codes to execute the same 
functionalities. Even the mechanism for calculating the 
command code is similar. Seasalt code is represented on the left and Oceansalt appears on the right: 

Command and capability similarities 
Both implants execute their capabilities in the same way, which indicates they were both developed from 
the same code base. The response codes used by both implants to indicate the success or failure of the commands executed on the endpoint are also an exact match. Some of these similarities: 
¡ö 
Drive reconnaissance capability: Similar code signatures. Both implants use the same codes to indicate the drive type to the control server. 


¡ö 
File reconnaissance capability: Similar API and code usage to get file information. The response codes sent to the control server to indicate whether a file was 
found is an exact match. 


¡ö 
Reverse-shell creation capability: Both implants use similar code signatures to create a reverse shell on the infected endpoint. Both reverse shells are based on 
cmd.exe. 


Code Differences from Seasalt 
There are a few differences between the two implants in implementation; these demonstrate that Oceansalt 
is not simply a recompilation of Seasalt source code. 
However, these differences also provide evidence that Oceansalt is an evolution of Seasalt. 
¡ö 
Encoding: The Oceansalt implant uses an encoding and decoding mechanism before any data is sent to 
the control server. The Seasalt implant does not use 
this encoding and sends unencrypted data to the 
control server. 
¡ö 
Control server address: Oceansalt uses a hardcoded 
control server address to establish communication. 
Seasalt parses the control address from its binary by decoding data. 
¡ö 
Persistence: Oceansalt has no persistence 
mechanisms to ensure continued infection over 
endpoint reboots. Seasalt, on the other hand, copies 
itself to C:\DOCUMEN~1\<userid>\java.exe and creates 
a registry entry to ensure infection after reboot: 
. HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\currentVersion\ Run | sysinfo 
¡ö 
Multiple code matches and similarities 
¡ö 
Multiple functional similarities 
¡ö 
Identical command capabilities 
¡ö 
Same command and response codes issued by and 
sent to the control server 
The code used to create the reverse shell in Oceansalt 
is an exact match with that of Comment Crew¡¯s Seasalt 
implant. The mechanism for creating the reverse shell 
(pipe-based inter-process communication for standard 
I/O handles) is also seen in Comment Crew implants such as WebC2-CSON and WebC2-GREENCAT. 
These matches lead us to believe that Oceansalt is 
based on Seasalt, because it reuses much of the code 
base developed 10 years ago. Seasalt¡¯s public disclosure in the Comment Crew report does not seem to have discouraged Oceansalt¡¯s developer. 
Obfuscated Oceansalt Comparison with Seasalt 
We offer a comparative analysis of the following partially 
obfuscated implants against the initial Oceansalt sample and the Seasalt implant from Comment Crew. 
SHA-1 Compile Date Role 

Based on the executable header information, Seasalt fc121db04067cffbed04d7403c1d222d376fa7ba 7/16/2018 Partially obfuscated Oceansalt 
was compiled on March 30, 2010. Oceansalt was 281a13ecb674de42f2e8fdaea5e6f46a5436c685 7/17/2018 Partially obfuscated Oceansalt 
compiled on June 1, 2018. Highlighting the compilation 
timestamps is important because, as our preceding 
analysis demonstrates, the samples have a high degree 
of code sharing:

0ae167204c841bdfd3600dddf2c9c185b17ac6d4  7/17/2018  Partially obfuscated Oceansalt  


All the partially obfuscated Oceansalt implants have the 
following characteristics: 
¡ö 
All implants were compiled during a three-day period: 
July 16¨C18 
¡ö 
All implants contain debug statements (print logs) 
written to the log file: C:\Users\Public\Videos\temp.log 
¡ö 
These debug statements begin with the timestamp and consist of the following keywords at the beginning of the debug message: 
. [WinMain] 
. [FraudProc] 
¡ö 
All implants connected to the same control server IP 
address: 27.102.112.179 
¡ö 
Although none of the partially obfuscated implants contain any additional capabilities (as compared with the initial Oceansalt or Seasalt), some of the partially 
obfuscated implants are missing the reverse-shell 
capabilities: 
Reverse-Shell

45C362F17C5DC8496E97D475562BEC4D  No

76C8DA4147B08E902809D1E80D96FBB4  Yes  

Evidence of Source-Code Sharing 
We present evidence of source-code sharing between 
the Oceansalt authors and Comment Crew, based on 
our comparative analysis of the three sets of samples: 
Oceansalt, partially obfuscated Oceansalt, and Seasalt. 
¡ö 
There is no possibility the attackers could have re-
instrumented Seasalt by simply modifying the control 
server IP addresses: 
. The mechanism for obtaining the address in Seasalt 
is different from Oceansalt¡¯s. Seasalt looks for 
encoded data at the end of the binary, decodes this 
data into tokens separated by the marker ¡°$,¡± and obtains the control server information. . Oceansalt implants have the control server IP 
addresses and port numbers hardcoded as plain-
text strings in the binaries 
¡ö 
Some of the partially obfuscated Oceansalt implants 
are missing the reverse-shell capability. All other 
capabilities (code signatures, response codes, etc.) and command codes are similar. (Command codes are 
either the same or off by 1.) Modifying capabilities in 
this fashion is possible only with access to the source code of Seasalt. 

¡ö 
The presence of debug strings tracing the code flow of 
the Oceansalt implants indicates they were compiled after adding debug information to the source code of Seasalt: 
. [WinMain]after recv cmd=%d 0Dh 0Ah . [WinMain]before recv 0Dh 0Ah . [FraudProc]Engine is still active! 0Dh 0Ah . [FraudPRoc]Process Restart! 0Dh 0Ah 
¡ö 
The presence of these debug strings also indicates 
that the authors who modified the source code may have used these samples to perform their initial 
testing before obfuscating and releasing the implants 
to their victims, without scrubbing the debug strings 
¡ö 
The Oceansalt implant 
531dee019792a089a4589c2cce3dac95 (compiled June 
1) contains a few key features that indicate compilation from the source code of Seasalt: 
. Does not contain the reverse-shell capability . Does not contain the drive recon capability . Loads API SHGetFileInfoA() dynamically without 
statically importing it. This also suggests that 
Seasalt¡¯s source code was modified before 
compilation. 


Oceansalt Capabilities 
Oceansalt is 76KB, a minimal on-disk footprint that is 
harder to detect than larger malware. The implant has a 
variety of capabilities for capturing data from the victim¡¯s 
machine using a structured command system. From 
our research we have determined that this implant is a first-stage component. Further stages are downloaded 
through its commands. Oceansalt also supports 
commands enabling the attacker to take various actions on the victim¡¯s system. 
Initial reconnaissance 
Oceansalt starts by trying to connect to its control server at 158.69.131.78:8080. Once connected, the implant 
sends the following information about the endpoint: 
¡ö 
IP address 
¡ö 
Computer name 
¡ö 
File path of the implant 
All data sent to the control server is encoded with a NOT 
operation on each byte. 



Command handler functions 
Oceansalt can execute 12 commands. Each command 
received from the control server is represented by a command code ranging from 0x0 to 0xB (0 to 11). 



0x0: Drive recon 
The control server sends this command code to Oceansalt to extract drive information from the endpoint. The format of the drive information: 
#<Drive _ letter>:<Drive _ type><Drive _ letter>:<Drive _ type>...# 
Legend Description 
<Drive_letter> A,B,C,D,E, etc., representing all logical drives on 
the system 
<Drive_type> 0 = DRIVE_REMOVABLE 1 = DRIVE_FIXED 2 = DRIVE_CDROM 3 = DRIVE_REMOTE 


0x1: File recon 
Sends the following information about a specific file (or file pattern) specified by the control server: 
¡ö 
Filename 
¡ö 
Type of file on disk, for example, file or folder 
¡ö 
¡°OK¡± if file was found on the location 
¡ö 
File creation time in format <YYYY-mm-DD HH:MM:SS> 
0x2: Command execute 
Executes a command line using WinExec(). The 
command line is provided by the control server along 
with the command number. For example: 
<DWORD representing command number><command line to be executed> 02 00 00 00 C:\Windows\system32\calc.exe 
The command line is executed with a hidden window 
(using the SW_HIDE option for WinExec()). 
0x3: File delete 
¡ö 
Deletes a file specified by the control server from the 
disk 
¡ö 
Once an operation is completed, the implant sends 
a ¡°0¡± (in ASCII) to the control server to indicate the 
successful execution of the command 
¡ö 
If the operation fails, Oceansalt sends a ¡°1¡± (in ASCII) to 
indicate failure 
0x4: File write 
¡ö 
Creates a file specified by a file path provided by the control server, which also provides the content to be written to the file path 
¡ö 
If the file write is successful, Oceansalt sends the keyword ¡°upfileok¡± indicating success 
¡ö 
If the file write fails, the implant sends the keyword ¡°upfileer¡± indicating failure 



0x6: Process recon 
¡ö 
Sends the name and ID for every process running on the system to the control server 
¡ö 
Process data is sent via individual packets, that is, one 
packet per process 


0x7: Process terminate 
¡ö 
Terminates a process whose ID has been specified by the control server 
0x8: Reverse shell create 
¡ö 
Opens a reverse shell from the infected endpoint to the control server using Windows pipes 
¡ö 
This reverse shell is based on cmd.exe. It can carry out 
further recon and make changes to the endpoint. 


0x9: Reverse shell operate 
¡ö 
Operates the reverse shell established using the previous command code 
¡ö 
Contains the commands sent by the control server to the reverse shell that will be executed by cmd.exe on 
the infected endpoint 
¡ö 
Once the command has been executed, the output is 
read from cmd.exe via a pipe and sent to the control server 
0XA: Reverse shell terminate 
¡ö 
Closes the reverse shell by closing handles to the pipes 
created for the shell¡¯s inter-process communication 
0XB: Connection test 
¡ö 
Tests receive and send capabilities of the implant by receiving data (0x7 bytes) from the control server and 
sending it back 
¡ö 
Persistence 
¡ö 
Oceansalt has no persistence capabilities to remain on the endpoint after the system reboots 
¡ö 
This lack suggests other components in the infection chain may ensure persistence and carry out other 
malicious activities 
Conclusion 
Based on our analysis, the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has named this global threat Operation 
Oceansalt. This operation has focused on targets in South Korea and other countries with new malware that 
has roots in Comment Crew activity from 2010. 
Our research shows that Comment Crew¡¯s malware in 
part lives on in different forms employed by another advanced persistent threat group operating primarily 
against South Korea. This research represents how threat actors including nation-states might collaborate on their campaigns. McAfee continues to monitor the threat landscape in Asia and around the world to track 
the evolution of known groups and changes to their techniques.
