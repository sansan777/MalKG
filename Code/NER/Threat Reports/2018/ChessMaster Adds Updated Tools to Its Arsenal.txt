Figure 1. Infection Chain for the current ChessMaster campaign 
ChessMaster’s current iteration starts off with the familiar phishing attacks seen in the earlier campaigns that involved the use of an email with an attached malicious document using the doc, docx, rtf, csv and msg formats. The email title and attached file name were written in Japanese and contain general business, political, and economy-themed phrases such as

世界Ug (World economy)

Ug政策 (economic policy)

予算概算要求 (budget estimation request)

日米 (Japan-US dialogue)

安倍再任 (re-appointment of Prime Minister Abe)

BjW (contact network)

T裼冒 (staff recruitment plan)


会h (meeting) However, there is a change in the exploit document. When we tracked ChessMaster back in November, we noted that it exploited the SOAP WSDL parser vulnerability CVE-2017-8759 (patched in September 2017) within the Microsoft .NET framework to download additional malware. While ChessMaster still uses the previous exploit, it also added more methods to its arsenal: one 
exploits another vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882 (patched in November 2017), which was also exploited to deliver illegal versions of the Loki infostealer.

It also abuses three legitimate MS Office functions:

Automatic Dynamic Data Exchange (DDEAUTO)  A legitimate Microsoft Office function used in an Office file to retrieve data from another Office file  .doc .rtf .msg

Figure 5. Exploitation of Link Auto Update 
ChessMaster can utilize any of these methods to download the next malware in the chain, the open source post-exploitation tool known as “Koadic,” which the previous campaign also used. This tool is responsible for stealing information ― specifically the environment information ― within the target system. 
Koadic executes the following command: 

%comspec% /q /c <cmd> 1> <Output> 2>&1 
The commands and output of Koadic will change according to the ANEL version used in the attack. The table belowlists examples of the commands and outputs for ANEL versions 5.1.1 rc and 5.1.2 rc1. Note that if ANEL 5.1.2 rc1 was downloaded, the attacker would use HTTPS to avoid the downloaded data being captured as clear text.

Figure 8. Command added when the Koadic RAT is downloaded (use of {Variable}.shell.exec command) 
If Koadic finds that the systemis conducive to the attacker’s interests, it downloads a base64-encrypted version of the ANEL malware fromthe Command-and-Control (C&C) server and executes it. Encrypted ANEL is decrypted using the “certutil -docode” command. When ANEL executes, a decrypted DLL file with the filename “lena_http_dll.dll” is expanded in memory. This file contains one export function ― either “crt_main” or “lena_main” 
Figure 9. Base64 encoded ANEL downloaded by Koadic 
ANEL will send the infected environment’s information to the C&C server. When sending the information, ANEL encrypts the data using blowfish, XOR, and Base64-based encryption methods. The format ANEL uses to send data is similar to ChChes, but ANEL’s encryption method is easier to use.

ConvertwebpagestopdfonlinewithPDFmyURLDifferences with regards to Backdoor commands: 
Figure 11. Summary of the changes between each version of ANEL

If no match above  Execute Command or File  

The differences shown in the table above are subtle but present. For example, the initial ANEL version, “5.0.0 beta1,” uses a different C&C server compared to the other versions. Once ANEL evolved to “5.1.1 rc,” it changed its file type to an executable, while also changing the C&C server. The third version we found (5.1.2 rc1) reverts to a DLL file type but retains the C&C server. The fourth version of ANEL (5.2.0 rev1) changes both the export function in the expanded main ANEL DLL and uses a different C&C server. Overall, we can see subtle changes, which indicate that the threat actors behind ANEL are making incremental improvements to the malware to refine it. 
ConvertwebpagestopdfonlinewithPDFmyURLFigure 12. Backdoor function differences between ANEL 5.0.0 beta1/5.1.1 rc/5.1.2 rc1 (left) and ANEL 5.2.0 rev1 (right) 
Once ANEL enters the user’s system, it will download various tools that could be used for malicious purposes, including password retrieval tools as well as malicious mail services and accessibility tools that will allowit to gather information about the system. These include Getpass.exe and Mail.exe, which are password and information stealers. 
It also downloads the following: 

Accevent.exe <-> Microsoft Accessible Event Watcher 7.2.0.0 

event.dll <-> the loader of ssssss.ddd, (Detected as TROJ_ANELLDR) 
ssssss.ddd (lena_http.bin) <-> encrypted BKDR_ANEL (Detected as BKDR_ANELENC) These three files work together using a common technique call DLL Side-Loading or DLL Hijacking. In this scenario, accevent.exe is the primary executable, which is usually legitimate. 
After the execution of accevent.exe, it loads event.dll, which will be placed in the same folder (so it takes loading priority), after which event.dll decrypts and loads the encrypted backdoor ssssss.ddd, which is BKDR_ANEL. When we analyzed ANEL 5.1.1 rc, encrypted ANEL 5.1.2 rc1 was downloaded and executed. 
Short-term mitigation 
When the user opens the document DDEAUTO or Link Auto Update, Office will display a message. If the user clicks on the “No” button, malicious activity will not initiate.

Medium-to long-term mitigation 
At first glance, it seems ChessMaster’s evolution over the past fewmonths involves subtle changes. However, the constant addition and changing of features and attack vectors indicate that the attackers behind the campaign are unlikely to stop and are constantly looking to evolve their tools and tactics. 
Organizations can implement various techniques and best practices to defend against targeted attacks, such as regular patching to prevent vulnerability exploitation and using tools that provide protection across different network levels. Solutions that feature behavior monitoring, application control, email gateway monitoring, and intrusion/detection systems can help with this. 
Given 
howcybercriminal 
tools, 
tactics 
and 
procedures 
are 
evolving, 
organizations 
will 
have 
to 
go 
beyond 
their 
typical 
day-to-day 
security 
requirements 
and 
find 
a 
way 
to 
preempt 
attacks. 
Thus, 
there 
is 
a 
pressing 
need 
to 
detect 
and 
address 
threats 
via 
a 
proactive 
incident 
response 
strategy. 

Essentially, this involves creating a remediation plan for effectively combating the threat and using round-the-clock intrusion detection and threat analysis to prevent attacks fromentering the system. A proactive strategy can be much more effective for targeted attacks, as these kinds of attacks are often designed to be elusive and difficult to detect, thus the need to scope themout. A comprehensive security strategy that involves proactive incident response will need the input of both decision makers and tech-savvy personnel, as they will need to be on the same page for it to be effective. 
In addition to implementing both mitigation techniques and proactive strategies, organizations can also strengthen their security by employing solutions such Trend Micro. Deep Security., Vulnerability Protection, and TippingPoint, which protects endpoints fromthreats that abuse vulnerabilities. 
In addition, comprehensive security solutions can be used to protect organizations fromattacks. These include Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro. Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free. Business Security, which can protect users and businesses fromthese threats by detecting malicious files, well as blocking all related malicious URLs. Trend Micro Deep Discovery. can protect enterprises by detecting malicious attachment and URLs. 
Trend Micro OfficeScan. with XGen. endpoint security infuses high-fidelity machine learning with other detection technologies and global threat intelligence for comprehensive protection against all kinds of threats.
