Analysis Of Targeted Attack Against Pakistan By Exploiting InPage Vulnerability And Related APT Groups 
By 360威胁情报中心 | 事件追踪 
Overview 
Recently, 360 Threat Intelligence Center found a series of targeted attacks against Pakistan targets. Attacker exploited one vulnerability (CVE-2017-12824) of InPage to craft bait documents (.inp). InPage is a word processing software designed speci.cally for Urdu speakers (o.cial language in Pakistan). In addition, O.ce documents with CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability were also used in the attack. Kaspersky disclosed one target attack in which InPage vulnerability was exploited in November 2016[6] . However, .rst attack by using such software vulnerability can be traced back to June 2016[14]. 
Through the analysis of this group of documents with InPage vulnerabilities and related attack activities, we can conclude that the attacker is BITTER APT organization disclosed by us in 2016 [5] . After further analysis, some samples in the attack have strong connections with some APT groups, speci.cally Patchwork, Bahamut, and Confucius. That shows more connections among those 4 APT groups from South Asian. 
Timeline 
360 Threat Intelligence Center sorts out the timeline of targeted attacks in which InPage vulnerability was exploited in the past two years as following: 

InPage Vulnerability Analysis (CVE-2017-12824) 
The scan result of documents with InPage vulnerability on VirusTotal: 

InPage is a word processing software specially designed for Urdu speakers, and the vulnerability number involved in the wild attack sample is CVE-2017-12824. 
After the analysis of the vulnerability by 360 Threat Intelligence Center, it was found that the vulnerability was caused by the fact that InPage word processing software did not check the data type (Type) to be processed when it is processing document .ow, which led to the out-of-bounds reading. Through carefully constructed InPage document, arbitrary code could be triggered to execute. 
11/29/2018 360威胁情报中心 
We used InPage 2015 software environment to analyze the vulnerability in detail, and the process is as follows. 

InPage 2015 
Cause of Vulnerability: Out-of-bound Read 
The essence of the CVE-2017-12824 vulnerability is out-of-bound Read. The InPage word processor does not check the data type to be processed while processing the InPage100 stream in the document, and the data type to be processed is speci.ed by a .eld in the InPage document. This allows an attacker to cause an InPage program to make an out-of-bounds read error by setting a value outside the Type range. 
The key data structures that trigger the vulnerability in document (.inp) are as follows. 0x7E and 0x72 represent a class of type in the document stream to be processed. We mark 0x7E as Type1 and 0x72 as Type2: 

InPage processes a.inp .le as follows: 
InPage .rst calls Ole!The StgCreateDoc.le function parses the entire.inp .le and then calls Ole! COleStreamFile: : OpenStream open InPage InPage100 data .ow in the document: 

11/29/2018 360威胁情报中心 
All the processing logic related to the InPage100 stream will be carried out in PraseInPage100_432750 function, and the data in the stream will be read with the callback function InPage100Read_440ED0: 

The trigger vulnerability Type data, 0x7E and 0x72 mentioned earlier, is eventually processed by the function sub_453590.The buf in the .gure below reads the data containing Type by calling InPage100Read_440ED0: 

The vulnerability function sub_453590 will select the corresponding processing process according to Type1 and Type2 (0x7E and 0x72 bytes). First, it reads the function pointer array according to Type1, then reads the function from the function pointer array according to Type2, and .nally calls the function to process data: 

Let's look at the assignment and range of dword_656A28 in the .gure above: 

Type1 = ECX(0x1F8)>>2 = 0x7E(126), Type2 = EDI(0x72) : 

Find the assignment of dword_656A28[0x7E] through IDA Pro: 

You can see that the actual size of the dword_656E60 array is 30 (0x1E) : 

Since the size of Type2 in the vulnerability document is set to 0x72, EDI=0x72, but the InPage does not judge the size of Type2 passed in, this will result in access to dword_656E60[0x72], and because 0x72>30(0x1E), an out-of-bounds read error occurs. 
The Exploitation 
Since the attacker sets Type2 in the document to 0x72, after addressing calculation, the code at the function address 0x00455AFA will be accessed across the line: 

You can see that dword_656E60[0x72] (0x455AFA) is just a pop retn instruction: 

The pop retn instruction sequence plays a role as "jump" address, when performing Type related processing function, due to the incoming parameters (pointer: 0 x031e383f) pointing to a data InPage document .ow, an attacker can .ll the controllable data .ow with ShellCode, so after the pop retn instructions will be returned directly to the attacker set ShellCode executed: 

However, the InPage program does not turn on DEP and ASLR protection, which results in ShellCode being directly executed: 

Analysis of Four Types of Attack Framework Using InPage Vulnerability 
360 Threat Intelligence Center conducted analysis on the samples with InPage vulnerabilities in Pakistan, found that a number of samples generated time, size, initial ShellCode InPage100 document .ow and related .ow label all consistent. We can con.rm that those samples come from same source. 

Through the analysis of this batch of InPage vulnerability utilization documents and relevant malicious code, we found that the malicious code carried by the vulnerability documents used four di.erent types of attack frameworks: four types of completely di.erent backdoor programs. The analysis is as follows. 
WSCSPL:Full -featured Backdoor 
11/29/2018 360威胁情报中心 
A decoy document captured by 360 Threat Intelligence Center is called "SOP for Retrieval of Mobile Data Records. Inp" (SOP for Mobile Data Records Retrieval). Cve-2017-12824 vulnerability utilization document will eventually download and execute a full-featured back door program named WSCSPL. 
Relevant vulnerability utilization document information is as follows: 
MD5  863f2bfed6e8e1b8b4516e328c8ba41b  
The .le name  For Retrieval of Mobile Data Records, SOP for Retrieval of Mobile Data Records. Inp  
ShellCode  

After the bug is successfully triggered, ShellCode will locate the main function ShellCode by searching the special logo "27862786". Then it will download Payload from khurram.com.pk/js/drv and save it to c:\conf\ smss.exe for execution: 
Downloader 
MD5 c3f5add704f2c540f3dd345f853e2d84 
Compile time 2018.9.24 
C: \ Users \ Asterix \ Documents \ 28 novdwn VisualStudio2008 \ Projects \ \ Release \ 2PDB path 8 novdwn PDB 
The downloaded EXE .le is mainly used to communicate with C2 and obtain the executables of other modules. After execution, the registry key value (key: HKCU\Environment, key value: AppId, data: c:\ Intel \drvhost. EXE) will be set .rst. 

Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the registry bootstrap: 

And determine whether the current process path is c:\ Intel \drvhost. Exe, if not, copy itself to the path and execute: 

When the process path meets the conditions, the machine GUID, computer user name and other information obtained from the registry are encrypted and concatenated into a string: 

Then send the constructed string to communicate with C2:nethosttalk.com and get the command to execute again: 

In this case, the C2 server returns an AXE:# instruction. The native program determines whether the instruction is an AXE:# or an AXE. 

If "AXE:#" is followed by the string content, the plug-in is downloaded and executed 

In the process of debugging and analysis by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analysts, we successfully obtained an executable plug-in named "WSCSPL" : 
Backdoor -WSCSPL 
MD5  1c2a3aa370660b3ac2bf0f41c342373b  
Compile time  2018.9.13  
Original .le name  Exe winsvc.  

This Trojan has same functionality as the Trojan used by Patchwork APT group disclosed by us in 2016[5]. The Trojan supports 17 commands, including uploading a list of hard disk, .nding, reading, creating a speci.ed .le, enumerating a list of processes, and ending a speci.ed process. Trojan function analysis is as follows: 
Set two 10-second interval timers after the Trojan program runs: 

Timer 1: request the IP of C&C:wcnchost.ddns.net. If the request is successful, save the IP to the global variable and set the id variable to 1. 

Timer 2: check the value of the identifying variable, if 1, try to connect C&C: 

Then create two threads: 

Thread 1: detects the connection status with C&C and receives the C&C command executable if the connection is successful 

Thread 2: checks whether the global variable dword_C9618 has data, and if so, sends the data to C&C 

The command execution code snippet is as follows: 

Trojan’s all commands and corresponding functions are shown in the following table: 
3000  Get RAT status information  
3001  Get computer hard disk information  
3002  Gets the list of .les in the speci.ed directory  
3004  Get RAT log 1  
3005  Create the speci.ed .le  
3006  Writes data to the create .le  
3007  Open the speci.ed .le  
3009  Reads the contents of the speci.ed .le  
3012  Create remote console  
3013  Execute remote commands  
3015  Get RAT log 2  
3016  End remote console  
3017  Closes the speci.ed handle  
3019  Gets a process that has an UPD active link  
3021  Get RAT log 3  
3032  End the speci.ed process  
3023  Gets process information in the system  
3025  Get RAT log 4  
Visual Basic Backdoor  

Another captured vulnerability exploit document, CVE-2017-12824 named ‘AAT national assembly .nal.inp’, drop the backdoor written by Visual Basic. Relevant vulnerability document information is as follows: MD5 ce2a6437a308dfe777dec42eec39d9ea The .le name The AAT national assembly .nal. Inp 
ShellCode 
First, ShellCode triggered by the vulnerability locates the main ShellCode through the memory global search string "LuNdLuNd" : 

Locate the main ShellCode and get the API functions you want to use, and ensure that only one instance runs by creating the mutex "QPONMLKJIH" : 

Then extract a DLL module contained in the document and execute it by memory loading:

e PDB The DLL .le loaded in memory is a Dropper, which contains two resource .les, "Bin" and "Bin2" : 

Bin .le is the back door program written by Visual Basic, while Bin2 is the normal inp decoy .le released and opened after the vulnerability is triggered. The contents of relevant decoy documents are as follows: 


Backdoor -SMTPLDR. Exe

Compile time  2018.7.4  
Original .le name  Exe SMTPLDR.  

11/29/2018 360威胁情报中心 
Bin .le is a backdoor program written by Visual Basic, which is mainly used to obtain command execution. After the Trojan horse runs, it .rst gets the installed application name of the current system from "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\" : 

Then determine whether the installed application includes kaspersky, NORTON, trend technology and other related software killing applications: 

Then WMI executes the select * from win32_computersystem command to get the application information and detect the virtual machine environment by determining whether the word "virtual" is included in the name: 

If the detection is in the virtual machine environment, the popover displays not a valid .le and exits: 

If the detection passes, "SMTP Loader. LNK" will be created in the directory of %Start% to achieve self-startup: 

Finally, it communicates with C&C: refer.le.com to obtain subsequent instruction execution: 

Delphi Backdoor Program 
360 Threat Intelligence Center found a batch of backdoor written by Delphi through big data correlation, which are also documents with InPage vulnerability. Relevant sample information is as follows: 
MD5 fec0ca2056d679a63ca18cb132223332 
Original .le name Exe adobsuit. 
The captured Delphi backdoor is the same as the backdoor written by Visual Basic, which is also released from the resource .le by similar Dropper and created by creating Adobe creative suit. LNK .le in the directory of %Start% and pointing to the implementation of persistence: 

The backdoor will Ducument in % % folder to create the users. The TXT .le, and random write 30 bytes of the string: 

Trojan program will access to a computer user name and the computer user name after encrypting the Ducument to % % / SyLog. The log .le: 

After that, I communicated with C2:errorfeedback.com and sent the contents of sylog.log .le as POST: 

When C2 returned to Success, and C2 communication in the form of HTTP GET request again, if return a string, continued to from "errorfeedback.com/ MarkQuality455 TTGKWoFdyQHEwpyYKmfVGtzQLfeqpJ/string" perform download the following content: 

A Backdoor Using Cobalt Strike 
Another captured InPage vulnerability exploit document ends up executing a backdoor generated by Cobalt Strike, with the following documentation information:

The decrypted .le is a DLL .le, which is then loaded and executed.DLL program will .rst determine the running environment and check whether the DLL loading process is rundll32.exe: 

If the loading process is not rundll32.dll, release the backdoor program named a.up64.dll under C: ProgramData\Adobe64: 

Exe "C:\ ProgramData\ Adobe64\ a.up64.dll", exe "C:\ ProgramData\ Adobe64\ a.up64.dll" 

Finally, start rundll32.exe to load a.up64.dll and call its export function IntRun:

Then, create "nnp74DE. TMP" .le in the directory of %TEMP%. Then, execute the command tasklist, ipcon.g./all, dir to get system process information, network information, .le list and so on. 

Then get the machine ID, system version, current system time, connect all the acquired information beginning with "tag Flu.yBunny", base64-encoded connect C&C and upload: 

After the information transmission is successful, Base64 encoding of the string "OK" will be returned: 

If the request line is not successful, the request line is looped.After the successful launch, it will enter the second stage to send base64-encoded data of calculation name-user name to jospubs/foth1018/go.php and obtain the command execution:

In the debugging process of 360 Threat Intelligence Center analysts, we successfully acquired a Trojan horse plug-in which was executed on the ground.The Trojan plugin continues to get the encrypted .le from pp5.zapto.org: 

Upon successful retrieval, hetero or decryption is performed, and the decrypted .le is a remote back door generated by Cobalt Strike: 


Analysis of CVE-2017-11882 Samples 
By expanding the big data platform of 360 Threat Intelligence Center, we found a vulnerability utilization document of O.ce cve-2017-11882 belonging to the same series of attack activities.The document is called "SOP for Retrieval of Mobile Data Records. Doc", which is the same name as the 
InPage vulnerability for the release of the WSCSPL Trojan (with the same origin as the Retrieval of the impersonal Records). However, the vulnerability document is targeted at Microsoft O.ce. MD5 61a107fee55e13e67a1f6cbc9183d0a4 The .le name For SOP for Retrieval of Mobile Data Records. Doc The Objdata object information containing the vulnerability is as follows: 

After the vulnerability successfully triggers the execution, subsequent Payload executables will be obtained by means of the same download address as the SOP for Retrieval of Mobile Data Records. Inp (InPage) vulnerability makes use of the .le for the Retrieval of Mobile Data Records: 

Attribution and Correlation 
360 Threat Intelligence Center through the analysis of this batch of InPage vulnerability utilization documents and related attack activities, it is the "BITTER" APT organization disclosed by 360 company in 
11/29/2018 360威胁情报中心 
2016 that is the group behind the targeted attack using WSCSPL backdoor program[5]And after further analysis, many samples in the series of attacks are also strongly related to APT organizations such as mahagrass, Bahamut and Confucius. 
BITTER APT Group 
After in-depth analysis of several InPage vulnerability documents with a relatively short attack time by 360 Threat Intelligence Center, it was found that the Trojan program released by the vulnerability document was the backdoor program used by APT organization "manlinghua" exposed by 360 company in 2016[5], is the analysis of the WSCSPL full -featured backdoor program. 
Command ID  Function  
2000  Retrieve RAT status information  
2001  Retrieve hard disk list  
2002  Retrieve .le list in given directory  
2004  Retrieve RAT log 1  
2005  Create .le by given .lename  
2006  Write bytes into created .le (2005)  
2007  Open .le  
2009  Read .le content (2007)  
2012  Create remote console  
2013  Execute remote command  
2015  Retrieve RAT log 2  
2016  Terminate remote console  
2017  Close handle  
2019  Retrieve a list of processes with UPD activity link  
2021  Retrieve RAT log 3  
2022  Terminate process by process ID  
2023  Retrieve a list of active processes  
2025  Retrieve RAT log 4  

In addition, many of these C&C addresses are also strongly related to APT organization "manlinghua" in the internal analysis platform of 360 Threat Intelligence Center. These C&C addresses have been repeatedly used in attacks against China.Therefore, the relevant attack activities can be identi.ed as "vine spirit .ower". 
Relation to Confucius 
11/29/2018 360威胁情报中心 
Delphi backdoor attack framework used in the C&C address errorfeedback.com in Trend Micro exploring Confucius and mahagrass similarity[10]Appears that the domain name has been disclosed as a trend of Confucius use. 
Relation to Patchwork 
Through the in-depth analysis and correlation of Delphi backdoor attack framework mentioned above, we also found that the attack framework and sample also appeared in the InPage attack sample analyzed by Palo Alto in 2017[13]Palo Alto thought the attack framework and backdoor might have something to do with mahagrass. 

Relation to "Bahamut" 
A vulnerability document "AAT national assembly .nal.inp" analyzed by 360 Threat Intelligence Center into the attack activity was .nally executed by the Trojan horse (Visual Basic backdoor program) using the domain name refer.le.com as C2, which was published by Cisco Talos security research team in July 2018 as "a case of targeted attack against Indian iOS users".[9]It was revealed that Talos security research team associated with this domain name was also used by a Visual Basic backdoor program, and the related network assets were suspected to be owned by APT organization "Bahamut". 

Summary and Conjecture 
360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzed a group of document samples with same attribution (timestamp, ShellCode, InPage100 .ow size, .ow characteristics) , and found that those samples use at least 4 di.erent malicious code framework, and have connections with "PatchWork", "BITTER”, "Confucius", "Bahamut" APT organization has produced more or less.Maybe these APT groups are actually one group? Or their digital weapons are provided by one vendor(Their supporter give them same exploitation tools)?
