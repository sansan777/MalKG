Background + Key findings
Transparent Tribe, also known as PROJECTM or MYTHIC LEOPARD, is a highly prolificgroup whose activities can be traced as far back as 2013. In the last four years, this APTgroup has never taken time off. They continue to hit their targets, which typically areIndian military and government personnel.
This is the second of two articles written to share the results of our recent investigationsinto Transparent Tribe. In the previous article, we described the various Crimson RATcomponents and provided an overview of impacted users. Here are some of the keyinsights that will be described in this part:
We found a new Android implant used by Transparent Tribe for spying on mobiledevices. It was distributed in India disguised as a porn-related app and a fakenational COVID-19 tracking app.
New evidence confirms a link between ObliqueRAT and Transparent Tribe.

Android implant
During our analysis, we found an interesting sample, which follows a variant of thepreviously described attack scheme. Specifically, the attack starts with a simpledocument, which is not malicious by itself, does not contain any macro and does not tryto download other malicious components, but it uses social engineering tricks to lure thevictim into downloading other documents from the following external URLs:
hxxp://sharingmymedia[.]com/files/Criteria-of-Army-Officers.doc
hxxp://sharingmymedia[.]com/files/7All-Selected-list.xls
15DA10765B7BECFCCA3325A91D90DB37 每 Special Benefits.docx
The remote files are two Microsoft Office documents with an embedded malicious VBA,which behaves similarly to those described in the previous article and drops the Crimson※Thin Client§. The domain sharingmymedia[.]com was even more interesting: it wasresolved with the IP 89.45.67[.]160 and was registered on 2020-01-10 using Namesiloand the following information:
Registrant Name: bluff hunnterRegistrant Organization:Registrant Street: India DehliRegistrant City: DehliRegistrant State/Province: DelhiRegistrant Postal Code: 110001Registrant Country: INRegistrant Phone: +91.4214521212Registrant Phone Ext:Registrant Fax:Registrant Fax Ext:Registrant Email: hunterbluff007@gmail.com
The same information was used to register another domain, sharemydrives[.]com, whichwas registered seven days before, on 2020-01-03, using Namesilo. DNS resolution pointsto the same IP address: 89.45.67[.]160.
Using our Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal, we found the following related URL:
Information in Kaspersky Threat Intelligence PortalThe file is a modified version of MxVideoPlayer, a simple open-source video player forAndroid, downloadable from GitHub and used by Transparent Tribe to drop and executetheir Android RAT.

The dropper tries to find a list of legitimate packages on the system:
imo.android.imoim
snapchat.android
viber.voip
facebook.lite

If the device was produced by Xiaomi, it also checks if the com.truecaller package ispresent.
The code used to check if legitimate packages are installed
The first application on the list that is not installed on the system will be selected as thetarget application. The malware embeds multiple APK files, which are stored in adirectory named ※assets§. The analyzed sample includes the following packages:
apk a20fc273a49c3b882845ac8d6cc5beac
apk 53cd72147b0ef6bf6e64d266bf3ccafe
apk bae69f2ce9f002a11238dcf29101c14f
apk b8006e986453a6f25fd94db6b7114ac2
apk 4556ccecbf24b2e3e07d3856f42c7072
apk 6c3308cd8a060327d841626a677a0549

The selected APK is copied to /.System/APK/. By default, the application tries to save thefile to external storage, otherwise it saves it to the data directory.
Finally, the application tries to install the copied APK. The final malware is a modifiedversion of the AhMyth Android RAT, open-source malware downloadable from GitHub,which is built by binding the malicious payload inside other legitimate applications.
The original AhMyth RAT includes support for the following commands:
Com-mands Addi-tionalfields Value Description 
x0000ca extra camlist get a camera list 
extra 1 get a photo from the camera with the id 1 
extra 0 get a photo from the camera with the id 0 
x0000fm extrapath

x0000cl get the call log 
x0000cn get contacts 
x0000mc sec %sec-onds% record audio from the microphone for the specifiednumber of seconds and upload the resulting file tothe C2. 
x0000lm get the device location 

Basically, it provides the following features:
camera manager (list devices and steal screenshots)
file manager (enumerate files and upload these to the C2)
SMS manager (get a list of text messages or send a text)
get the call log
get the contact list
microphone manager
location manager (track the device location)

The RAT that we analyzed is slightly different from the original. It includes new featuresadded by the attackers to improve data exfiltration, whereas some of the core features,such as the ability to steal pictures from the camera, are missing.
The operators added the following commands:
x000upd 每 download a new APK from the URL specified in the ※path§ field.
x000adm 每 autodownloader: not implemented in the version we analyzed, butavailable in other samples.

Moreover, the creators of the RAT also improved its audio surveillance capabilities andincluded a command to delete text messages with specific contents.
Com-mands Addi-tionalfields Value Description 
x000upd path %url% download a new APK from the URL specified in the※path§ field 
x000adm not implemented in the analyzed version. Othersamples use this to start a class named※autodownloader§. 
x0000mc extrasec
 au%sec-onds%
 record audio for x seconds and upload the result-ing file to the C2. Duration is specified in the ※sec§value. 
extra mu stop recording and upload the resulting file to theC2 
extra muS start recording continuously. This generates MP3files stored in the ※/.System/Records/§ directory. 
x0000fm extrapath
 ls%dirpath%

 Delete a text that contains the string specified inthe ※sms§ value. The ※to§ value is ignored. 
x0000cl get the call log 
x0000cn get contacts 
x0000lm get the device location 

The ※autodownloader§ is a method used for performing the following actions:
upload a contact list
upload a text message list
upload files stored in the following directories:/.System/Records/
/Download/
/DCIM/Camera/
/Documents/
/WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Images/
/WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Documents/



The attacker uses the method to collect contacts and text messages automatically. Inaddition, the method collects the following: audio files created with the ※x0000mc§command and stored in /.System/Records/, downloaded files, photos, images anddocuments shared via WhatsApp and other documents stored on the device.
Another interesting difference between the original AhMyth and the one modified byTransparent Tribe is the technique used for getting the C2 address. The original versionstores the C2 server as a string directly embedded in the code, whereas the modifiedversion uses a different approach. It embeds another URL encoded with Base64 and usedfor getting a configuration file, which contains the real C2 address.
In our sample, the URL was as follows:
hxxp://tryanotherhorse[.]com/config.txt
It provided the following content:
212.8.240.221:5987
http://www.tryanotherhorse.com
The first value is the real C2, which seems to be a server hosted in the Netherlands.
The modified version communicates via a different URL scheme, which includes moreinformation:
Original URL scheme: http://%server%:%port?model=%val%&manf=%val%&release=%val%&id=%val%
Modified URL scheme http://%server%:%port?mac=%val%&battery=%val%&model=%val%&manf=%val%&release=%val%&id=%val%

Covid-19 tracking app
We found evidence of Transparent Tribe taking advantage of pandemic-trackingapplications to distribute trojanized code. Specifically, we found an APK file imitatingAarogya Setu, a COVID-19 tracking mobile application developed by the NationalInformatics Centre under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology,Government of India. It allows users to connect to essential health services in India.
The discovered application tries to connect to the same malicious URL to get the C2 IPaddress:hxxp://tryanotherhorse[.]com/config.txt
It uses the same URL scheme described earlier and it embeds the following APKpackages:
apk CF71BA878434605A3506203829C63B9D
apk 627AA2F8A8FC2787B783E64C8C57B0ED
apk 62FAD3AC69DB0E8E541EFA2F479618CE
apk A912E5967261656457FD076986BB327C
apk 3EB36A9853C9C68524DBE8C44734EC35
apk 931435CB8A5B2542F8E5F29FD369E010

Interestingly enough, at the end of April, the Indian Army issued a warning to itspersonnel against Pakistani agencies＊ nefarious designs to hack the phones of Indianmilitary personnel through a malicious application similar to Aarogya Setu.
According to some Indian online news sites, these applications were found to be sent byPakistani Intelligence Operatives to WhatsApp groups of Indian Army personnel. It alsomentioned that these applications later deployed additional packages:
According to some Indian online news sites, these applications were found to be sent byPakistani Intelligence Operatives to WhatsApp groups of Indian Army personnel. It alsomentioned that these applications later deployed additional packages:
face.apk
imo.apk
normal.apk
trueC.apk
snap.apk
viber.apk

Based on public information, the application may have been distributed by sending amalicious link via WhatsApp, SMS, phishing email or social media.
ObliqueRAT connection
ObliqueRAT is another malicious program, described by Cisco Talos in an interestingarticle published in February. It was attributed to Transparent Tribe because somesamples were distributed through malicious documents forged with macros thatresembled those used for distributing Crimson RAT.
The report described two ObliqueRAT variants, one distributed via a malicious documentas the infection vector and another one, named ※Variant #0§ and distributed with adropper.
4a25e48b8cf515f4cdd6711a69ccc875429dcc32007adb133fb25d63e53e2ac6
Unfortunately, as reported by Talos, ※The initial distribution vector of this dropper iscurrently unknown§.
At this time, we do not have the full infection chain, but we can add another piece to thepuzzle, because sharemydrives[.]com also hosted another file:
Information in Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal
The wifeexchange.exe sample is another dropper, which disguises itself as a porn clip.
Specifically, the executable file uses the same icon used by Windows for multimedia files.

Dropper icon
Once executed, the process tries to find a specific marker (※*#@§)inside its file image, then drops and opens the following files:
frame.exe 每4a25e48b8cf515f4cdd6711a69ccc875429dcc32007adb133fb25d63e53e2ac6
movie.mp4

Frame.exe is the dropper described by Talos, while movie.mp4 is a small porn clip.
Conclusions
Transparent Tribe members are trying to add new tools to extend their operations andinfect mobile devices. They are also developing new custom .NET tools like ObliqueRAT,and as observed in the first report, we do not expect this group to slow down any timesoon. We will keep monitoring their activities.
