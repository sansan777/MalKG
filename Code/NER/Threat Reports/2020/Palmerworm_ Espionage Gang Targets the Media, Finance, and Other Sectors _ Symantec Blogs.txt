Translation: .掛惤Companies in Japan, Taiwan, U.S., and China among victims.
The Threat Hunter Team at Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ:.AVGO), hasuncovered a new espionage campaign carried out by the Palmerworm group (akaBlackTech) involving a brand new suite of custom malware, targeting organizations inJapan, Taiwan, the U.S., and China.
The attacks occurred in 2019 and continued into 2020, targeting.organizations in themedia, construction, engineering, electronics, and finance sectors. We observed the groupusing previously unseen malware in these attacks.
Palmerworm uses a combination of custom malware, dual use tools, and living-off-the-land tactics in this campaign. Palmerworm has been active since at least 2013, with thefirst activity seen in this campaign in August 2019.
Tactics, Tools, and Procedures
Palmerworm was observed using both dual-use tools and custom malware in theseattacks.
Among the custom malware families we saw it use were:
Backdoor.Consock
Backdoor.Waship
Backdoor.Dalwit
Backdoor.Nomri

We have not observed the group using these malware families in previous attacks 每 theymay be newly developed tools, or the evolution of older Palmerworm tools. Malware usedby Palmerworm in the past has included:
Backdoor.Kivars
Backdoor.Pled

While the custom malware used by the group in this campaign is previouslyundocumented, other elements of the attack bear similarities to past Palmerwormcampaigns, making us reasonably confident that it is the same group carrying out thiscampaign.
As well as the four backdoors mentioned, we also see the group using a custom loader anda network reconnaissance.tool, which Symantec detects as Trojan Horse and Hacktool.The group also used several dual-use tools, including:
Putty 每 can be leveraged by attackers for remote access, to exfiltrate data and sendit back to attackers
PSExec 每 is a legitimate Microsoft tool that can be exploited by malicious actorsand used for lateral movement across victim networks
SNScan 每 this tool can be used for network reconnaissance, to find other potentialtargets on victim networks
WinRAR 每 is an archiving tool that can be used to compress files (potentially tomake them easier to send back to attackers) and also to extract files from zippedfolders

All these dual-use tools are commonly exploited by malicious actors like Palmerworm,with advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like this increasingly using living-off-the-land tactics, including the use of dual-use tools, in recent years. These tools provideattackers with a good degree of access to victim systems without the need to createcomplicated custom malware that can more easily be linked back to a specific group.
In this campaign, Palmerworm is also using stolen code-signing certificates to sign itspayloads, which makes the payloads appear more legitimate and therefore more difficultfor security.software to detect. Palmerworm has been publicly documented using stolencode-signing certificates in previous attack campaigns.
We did not see what infection vector Palmerworm used to gain initial access to victimnetworks in this campaign, however, in the past the group has been documented as usingspear-phishing emails to gain access to victim networks.
Victims
Symantec identified multiple victims in this campaign, in a number of industries,including media, construction, engineering, electronics, and finance. The media,electronics, and finance companies were all based in Taiwan, the engineering companywas based in Japan, and the construction company in China. It is evident Palmerwormhas a strong interest in companies in this region of East Asia.
We also observed Palmerworm activity on some victims in the U.S., however, we wereunable to identify the sector of the companies targeted.
Palmerworm activity was first spotted in this campaign in August 2019, when activity wasseen on the network of a Taiwanese media company and a construction company inChina. The group remained active on the network of the media company for a year, withactivity on some machines there seen as recently as August 2020.
Palmerworm also maintained a presence on the networks of a construction and a financecompany for several months. However, it spent only a couple of days on the network of aJapanese engineering company in September 2019, and a couple of weeks on the networkof an electronics company in March 2020. It spent approximately six months on one ofthe U.S.-based machines on which we observed activity.
Figure. The amount of time Palmerworm spent on the networks of companies in the different sectors varied from a year to just a few days
The finance, media, and construction industries, then, appear to be of the biggest interestto Palmerworm in this campaign. There have been reports previously of Palmerwormtargeting the media sector.
What do the attackers want?
While we cannot see what Palmerworm is exfiltrating from these victims, the group isconsidered an espionage group and its likely motivation is considered to be stealinginformation from targeted companies.
How do we know this is Palmerworm?
While the custom malware used in this attack is not malware we have seen used byPalmerworm before, some of the samples identified in this research are detected by othervendors as PLEAD, which is a known Palmerworm (aka Blacktech) malware family. Wealso saw the use of infrastructure that has previously been attributed to Palmerworm.
The group＊s use of dual-use tools has also been seen in previous campaigns identified asbeing carried out by Palmerworm, while the location of its victims is also typical of thegeography targeted by Palmerworm in past campaigns. The group＊s use of stolen code-signing certificates has also been observed in previous Palmerworm attacks. Thesevarious factors make us reasonably confident we can attribute this activity toPalmerworm.
Symantec does not attribute Palmerworm＊s activity to any specific geography, however,Taiwanese officials have stated publicly that they believe Blacktech, which we track asPalmerworm, is backed by the Chinese government.
Conclusion
APT groups continue to be highly active in 2020, with their use of dual-use tools andliving-off-the-land tactics making their activity ever harder to detect, and underlining theneed for customers to have a comprehensive security solution in place that can detect thiskind of activity.
Protection
The following protections are in place to protect customers against Palmerworm activity:
Backdoor.Consock
Backdoor.Waship
Backdoor.Dalwit
Backdoor.Nomri
Backdoor.Kivars
Backdoor.Pled
Hacktool
Trojan Horse
