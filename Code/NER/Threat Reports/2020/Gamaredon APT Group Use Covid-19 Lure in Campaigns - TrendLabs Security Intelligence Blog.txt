Gamaredon is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been active since 2013. Their campaigns are generally known for targeting Ukrainian governmentinstitutions. From late 2019 to February of this year, researchers published several reports on Gamaredon, tracking the group’s activities. 
In March, we came across an email with a malware attachment that used the Gamaredon group’s tactics. Some of the emails used the coronavirus pandemic as a topicto lure victims into opening emails and attachments. These campaigns targeted victims in European countries and others. 

A brief history of Gamaredon 
In 2015, researchers from LookingGlass published the .rst report on Gamaredon. According to that report, the early campaigns used Microsoft Word documents that,when inspected, showed that its most recent user went by the name of Armagedon (a misspelled “Armageddon”), which became the basis of the group’s namesake. 
The report also described Gamaredon’s political beginnings, particularly its ties to the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. Before the revolution they had targetedUkrainian government of.cials, opposition party members, and journalists. They moved on to Ukrainian government institutions after the revolution. In 2018, CERT-UA published an advisory against the malware Pterodo, which the group allegedly used. 
The group remained active, with several Gamaredon-related activities reported in February 2020. In March, they were among the threat groups that were identi.ed taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to trick targets. 

Gamaredon and Covid-19-related cover emails 
Figure 1. The infection chain of the Gamaredon campaign 
The case we found arrived through a targeted email that contained a document .le (in docx format). Opening document starts a template injection technique forloading the document template from the internet. The downloaded document template contains the malicious macro codes, which executes a VBScript (VBS). Wefound a mechanism for decrypting, executing, and downloading an additional payload from the C&C server. During the time of the analysis however, the C&C serverwas not accessible, which made us unable to get additional payloads. 
The attacks we found all arrived through targeted emails (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1193). One of them even had the subject “Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).”The use of socially relevant topics is a common practice for attackers who wish to make their emails and documents more tempting to open. The email that used thecoronavirus-related subject came with an attached document .le. Opening this .le (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1204) executes the template injection method(MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1221). 
Figure 2. Code for downloading the document template with the malicious macro 
The downloaded document template (in dot format) could differ slightly depending on each download. However, its Exif info or metadata remains consistent andshares the following details: 

Identi.cation: Word 8.0 

Language code: Russian

System: Windows

Author: АДМИН (“Administrator” in Russian)

Code page: Windows Cyrillic 
Figure 3. A sample of malicious macro in the downloaded template document 
As mentioned, the template contains malicious macro (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064), which exports VBS (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064) toexecute itself. More speci.cally it drops “%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs,” which is hardcoded in the macro, and then executed in“wscript.exe //b %USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs.” 
Figure 4. A content sample for VBS dropped by malicious macro 
PlayList.vbs contains the obfuscated codes (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1140), which it executes after decrypting the obfuscations. This particular behavior isa slight departure from previously reported attacks by Gamaredon, which did not use this technique. 
Figure 5. A sample of executed VBS 
Figure 5 shows a snippet of the VBS executed by the Execute function. The routines it follows are enumerated below. 
1. Register the RUN key in the registry below, so that the VBS .le is executed every time the machine starts (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1060)

Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\MediaPlayer wscript.exe //b％USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs
2. Connect with “hxxp:// kristom[.]hopto[.]org /{computer name}_{hexadecimal volume serious number}/help_05_03[.]php” (MITRE ATT&CK framework IDsT1043, T1071, T1082)
3. If the downloaded .le size in the .rst step exceeds 10,485 bytes, then the .le is saved as “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.txt” (MITRE ATT&CKframework ID T1105)
4. Use XOR for the .le saved from the second step, where ASCII code converted from its own hexadecimal volume serial number is used as the key. Thedecrypted result is saved as “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” (T1001)
5. If the .le size of “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” exceeds 4,485 bytes, it is executed. 
6. Both “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.txt” and “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” are then deleted (MITRE ATT&CKframework ID T1107) 

The observed routines of this VBS closely follow the other reports published on Gamaredon, such as the one from SentinelOne. However, the macro generated VBS was obfuscated in this case, likely as an additional evasive tactic. 
Interestingly, after decoding the VBS, we saw what appeared to be a programming mistake by the attacker. Lines 53 and 54 in .gure 6 are for closing thosedownloaded and decoded TXT and EXE .les, which are variables de.ned right before the IF statement. If, however, these lines do not pass through this IF statement,an error would occur. It shows that this malware is not tested enough, and may still be under development. 
Our analysis found several URLs of the network destinations for both template injection and VBS. While resolving them to IP addresses to understand their attackbases, we also found that they were all linked to the following IP addresses. 

Network destination for template injection: 176[.]119[.]147[.]225

Network destination for VBS: 176[.]57[.]215[.]115 

These IP addresses are from Russian hosting companies. Most likely, the attackers rented Virtual Private Server (VPS) as their attack base. Their URL for VBS(shown below) likely includes the data when they conducted the attack. 

hxxp://{FQDN}/{computer name}_{hexadecimal volume serial number}/help_{day}_{month}[.]php 

Conclusion 
Gameradon is not the .rst group to take advantage of the Covid-19 topic. Some cybercriminals have taken to indirect means of pro.ting, such as by targeting 
communication platforms that have increased in popularity after organizations shifted to work from home setups. In this case, they used Covid-19 as a cover for theirrelatively typical APT routine. We recommend these countermeasures to prevent similar APT attacks in the future: 

Check the email sender, subject, and body for anything suspicious before downloading and opening email attachments. Be especially wary of unsolicitedemails, that come from unknown senders.Check the .le extension of the attached .le and make sure it is the intended .le format. Avoid activating macro for any attached Microsoft Of.ce .les, especially for emails that request macro activation using an image of the body of the opened .leor those that don’t show anything.Watch out for spoofed domains embedded in emails before opening them. Subtle changes to a popular URL can be one indicator of malicious content. 
In addition to these actions, users can also implement a multi-layer approach and take advantage of these solutions.
