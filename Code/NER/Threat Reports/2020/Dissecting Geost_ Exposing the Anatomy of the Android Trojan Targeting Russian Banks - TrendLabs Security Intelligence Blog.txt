The Android banking trojan Geost was .rst revealed in a research by Sebastian García, Maria Jose Erquiaga and Anna Shirokova from the Stratosphere Laboratory. 
They detected the trojan by monitoring HtBot malicious proxy network. The botnet targets Russian banks, with the victim count at over 800,000 users at the time the study was published in Virus Bulletin last year. 
The research disclosed the types of information that Geost (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_Fobus.AXM) steals from victims, as well as the activities of thegroup behind the botnet, including operational tactics and internal communication between masters and botnet coders. 
Building upon this interesting .nding, we decided to dig deeper into the behavior of Geost by reverse engineering a sample of the malware. The trojan employedseveral layers of obfuscation, encryption, re.ection, and injection of non-functional code segments that made it more dif.cult to reverse engineer. To study the codeand analyze the algorithms, we had to create Python scripts to decrypt strings .rst. 
Initial Analysis 
Geost hides in malicious apps that are distributed via unof.cial web pages with randomly generated server hostnames. The victims usually encounter these as theylook for apps that are not available on Google Play, or when they don’t have access to the app store. They then .nd a link to that application on some obscure webserver, download the app, then launch it on their phones. The app will then request for permissions that, when the victims allow, enables malware infection. 
The Geost sample we analyzed resided in the malicious app named “установка” in Russian, which means “setting” in English. The app showed a version of theGoogle Play logo as its own icon, which did not appear on the phone screen after launch. 
Figure 1. Application icon of the malicious app установка 
When the app was launched, it requested device administrator privileges. This was unusual since legitimate apps don’t often ask for this, as it basically gives an appcomplete rights over a device. 
Important permissions that the user might unknowingly allow include those for accessing SMS messages, including con.rmation messages from banking apps. Thesemessages allow the malware to harvest the victims’ names, balances, and other bank account details. With just a few clicks, attackers can then transfer money fromthe bank accounts of unaware victims. 
Figure 2: Screen that requests device admin permission 
Figure 3: Application permissions requested 
After con.rming necessary permissions, the visible part of the app will close and the app icon disappears, making victims think that the app was deleted. The sampledevice did not show any alarming signs of malicious activity at .rst, but the malware is working in the background and the attackers just gained access to the device,allowing them to monitor sent and received messages, including SMS con.rmation messages from banking apps. 
To maintain persistence across reboots, it registers for BOOT_COMPLETED and QUICKBOOT_POWERON broadcasts. 
Figure 4: Registering services to boot broadcasts (some codes were obfuscated) 

Stage One 
Like many malware types, Geost’s run-time life is split into stages. The .rst stage is small and simple, which will then download and/or decrypt and run the nextstage, which is more complex. 
The Geost sample’s APK housed compiled Java code in classes.dex .le. It also contained AndroidManifest.xml and resource .les, which are usual contents of APK.les. It also had a “.cache” .le with a size of 125k. 
To decompile the extracted classes.dex .le, several Java decompilers, namely dex2jar, jadx, jd-core/jd-gui and Ghidra, were all used, as no single decompiler wasable to decompile all the Smali code. 
Figure 5: Decompiled Java source code 
At .rst glance, the decompiled code seemed to be partially encoded in a series of strings; however, character frequency analysis showed random character usage. 
Further analysis revealed that the malware contained additional pieces of code that have no impact on the app’s behavior except to slow down its execution. It madereverse engineering more dif.cult because the malware split useful code into parts and frequently changed execution paths. Which branch was taken was usuallydependent on some variable with an unknown value. The same is applied with “switch”, “if”, and “try/catch” command blocks. Functions without meaningful codewere inserted to make overall understanding of the malware actions harder. 
Figure 6: Example of code with case switch 
The non-functional code segments were gradually removed and the .rst decryption algorithm used was identi.ed. All strings in stage one were encrypted throughRC4, using an algorithm that was split into several functions to avoid indication that it used RC4. After this, the next step was to .nd the key for RC4 decryption. 
Figure 7: Decompiled Java source, which is part of the RC4 algorithm 
Figure 8: Part of cleaned up RC4 code 
Figure 9: RC4 key 
RC4 is a stream cipher, with an internal state that changes with every decrypted symbol. To decrypt several encrypted strings, usually the decryption must beperformed in the very same order the encryption used. Fortunately, this was not the case with the sample. The code authors simpli.ed RC4 without keeping internalstate between decryptions, as the RC4 encryption code always copied state array S[]. 
Figure 10: RC4 encryption always copied state array S[] 
Afterwards, the search for common code libraries began. Android.support.v4 libraries and Re.ectASM Java Re.ection libraries were found. 
Figure 11: Code with encrypted strings 
Figure 12: Code with strings after decryption and symbol deobfuscation 
At this point, the stage one code became understandable: It uses re.ection code to hide interesting classes and methods from curious eyes. Basically, the .rst stagedecrypted the second stage .le with the same RC4 algorithm and key. 
The aforementioned “.cache” .le is renamed to .localsinfotimestamp1494987116 and saved after decryption as ydxwlab.jar, from which the .dex .le is loaded andlaunched. 
Figure 13: Example of re.ection method invocation 
Figure 14: Decrypting and saving second stage 
Code authors inserted a false .ag, HttpURLConnection and its URL, which seemed to connect to the Command and Control (C&C) server. But this http openconnection is never executed. 
Figure 15: False .ag 
Stage one loads a class from the second stage, which the researcher named “MaliciousClass”. 
Figure 16: Launching the second stage 

Stage Two 
Looking at the classes.dex, it’s clear that obfuscation and encryption were used again in stage two. But this time, the symbol names were partially replaced by strings1-2 characters long instead of the previous 6-12 character strings. Also, the string encryption algorithm is modi.ed, making it different from the algorithm used in theprevious stage. Different tools were used. Additionally, parameters of the decryption algorithm were modi.ed separately for each class. 
All Java decompilers had problems decompiling the decryption algorithm due to goto command jumping into the if block. Only Jeb decompiler handled thisconstruction well. 
Figure 17: Smali code of decryption algorithm 
Figure 18: Java code of decryption algorithm 
Each class decryption method contained different parameter orders and different constants; writing the Python decryption script was made more dif.cult. It meanteither the decryption script must detect the algorithm setup from the Smali code and adapt itself, or the parameters must be manually set up within the script beforedecryption for each class. 
Figure 19: Example of an encrypted string 
After string decryption, libraries used could be detected. These include: 
AES encryption engineBase64 encodingEmulator detector File download service IExtendedNetworkService USSD api libraryZip4jUtil 

Initialization phase 
The aforementioned MaliciousClass invoked from the .rst stage serves as an envelope for the instantiated class the researcher named “Context.” 
Figure 20: Context Class 
The Context class launches the EmulatorDetector service .rst. It then starts two other services: AdminService and LPService, followed by the main applicationIntent. 
Figure 21: Main initialization routine 
Emulator Detector 
The emulator detector checks for signs that it’s running in an emulated environment. The sample detected the existence of Nox, Andy, Geny, Bluestacks and QemuAndroid emulators. 
Figure 22: Emulated enviroment traces 
AdminService 
This service is responsible for granting admin permission to the application. This is a critical part since it enables access to sensitive data and can launch privilegedactions. 
Figure 23: Critical part of AdminService 
LPService 
This service was responsible for keeping the application running and connected to the C&C server. It used WakeLock and Wi.Lock acquire() calls to reach this state.A side effect to this is high battery drain, which most victims usually ignore. 
Figure 24: Locking to CPU and WiFi resources 
LPService then creates LPServiceRunnable Thread, which wakes up every .ve seconds and is responsible for monitoring and relaunching these services: 

MainService AdminService SmsKitkatService 


This service also collects information about running processes and tasks. It also periodically starts WebViewActivity, which can open browser window to arbitraryURLs or launch malicious code. WebViewActivity code was not implemented in this sample. 
MainService 
The MainService .rst hooks to AlarmManager for time scheduling tasks, then registers two broadcast receivers, MainServiceReceiver1 and MainServiceReceiver2.At the end of the initialization phase, it will launch MainServiceRunnable Thread. When the sample executes overloaded onDestroy() method, it restarts theMainService again. 
Figure 25: Overloaded onDestroy to restart MainService 
An important method of MainService is processApiResponse(), which processes commands formatted as JSON string received from C&C server. 
Figure 26: Processing C&C server commands 
ClearService 
This service invokes the ClearServiceRunnable thread, which takes care of locking/unlocking commands (blocking/unblocking user activity) so the botnet operatorcan perform remote tasks without user intervention. The ClearService also relaunches itself if there is an attempt to terminate it. 
Figure 27: ClearService class 
Figure 28: ClearServiceRunnableSmsKitkatService 
This service was prepared to replace the standard SMS messaging application with a different one written by the attackers. In this version, it used a default one.

ApiRequest, ApiResponse, ApiInterfaceImpl 
The ApiRequest, ApiResponse, and ApiInterfaceImpl classes enable communication with the C&C server. In the connection parameters initialization, the value ofreplaceWithRandomStr variable was set to true by default and is not changed within the code. 
Figure 31: Building C&C server connection string 
Figure 32: Connection parameters initialization 
An algorithm was used to generate a random string for the C&C server URL. The API connection was then initialized, and the hostname of the C&C server was set up. 
Figure 33: Building random string for the C&C server URL 
Figure 34: API connection initialization 
An example of C&C server API usage was shown as the C&C server command “#contacts“ was implemented. Finally, parameters for commands are appended asJSON format and converted to string.

Best Practices and Trend Micro Solutions 
In its 2020 Security Predictions, Trend Micro predicted the continued proliferation of mobile malware families, such as Geost, that target online banking and paymentsystems. Mobile users should safeguard themselves as they navigate the treacherous mobile landscape by following best practices for securing mobile devices. One 
such step is to avoid downloading apps outside of.cial app stores. 
Unfortunately, threat actors also .nd ways to spread malicious apps via legitimate app stores. Along with the continued campaigns of these stores to remove 
compromised apps, users can also avoid such apps by carefully inspecting app reviews and other information before downloading.

App users should scrutinize the permissions requested by an installed app before allowing them. Afterwards, users should watch out for changes in their devices, suchas the decreased performance or battery life, which may indicate a malware infection. In this case, users should delete the newly installed app immediately. Usersshould also conduct regular audits to remove unused apps. 
For additional defense against mobile threats, users can install a multilayered mobile security solution such as Trend Micro. Mobile Security.to protect devices frommalicious applications and other mobile threats.
