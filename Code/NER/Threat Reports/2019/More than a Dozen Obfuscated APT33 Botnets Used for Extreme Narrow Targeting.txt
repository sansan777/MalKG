This threat group has been reported on consistently for years, but our recent .ndings show thatthe group has been using about a dozen live Command and Control (C&C) servers for extremely narrowtargeting. The group puts up multiple layers of obfuscation to run these C&C servers in extremely targetedmalware campaigns against organizations in the Middle East, the U.S., and Asia. We believe these botnets, each comprising a small group of up to a dozen infected computers, are used togain persistence within the networks of select targets. The malware is rather basic, and has limitedcapabilities that include downloading and running additional malware. Among active infections in 2019 aretwo separate locations of a private American company that offers services related to national security, victimsconnecting from a university and a college in the U.S., a victim most likely related to the U.S. military, andseveral victims in the Middle East and Asia. APT33 has also been executing more aggressive attacks over the past few years. For example, for at least twoyears the group used the private website of a high-ranking European politician (a member of her country¡¯sdefense committee) to send spear phishing emails to companies that are part of the supply chain of oilproducts. Targets included a water facility that is used by the U.S. army for the potable water supply of one ofits military bases. These attacks have likely resulted in concrete infections in the oil industry. For example, in the fall of 2018,we observed communications between a U.K.-based oil company with computer servers in the U.K. andIndia and an APT33 C&C server. Another European oil company suffered from an APT33 related malwareinfection on one of their servers in India for at least 3 weeks in November and December 2018. There were several other companies in oil supply chains that had been compromised in the fall of 2018 as well. Thesecompromises indicate a big risk to companies in the oil industry, as APT33 is known to use destructivemalware. Date From Address Subject12/31/16 recruitment@alsalam.aero Job Opportunity4/17/17 recruitment@alsalam.aero Vacancy Announcement 7/17/17 careers@ngaaksa.com Job Openning9/11/17 jobs@ngaaksa.ga Job Opportunity11/20/17 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning11/28/17 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning3/5/18 jobs@mail.dyn-corp.ga Job Openning7/2/18 careers@sipchem.ga Job Opportunity SIPCHEM7/30/18 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning8/14/18 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning8/26/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy 8/28/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy 9/25/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga AramCo Jobs 10/22/18 jobs@samref.ga Job Openning at SAMREF Table 1. Spear phishing campaigns of APT33. Source: Trend Micro¡¯s Smart Protection Network The .rst two email addresses in the table above (ending in .com and .aero) are being spoofed by the threatgroup. However, the addresses ending in .ga are from the attacker¡¯s own infrastructure. The addresses are allimpersonating known aviation and oil and gas companies. Aside from the relatively noisy attacks of APT33 against oil product supply chains, we found that APT33 hasbeen using several C&C domains for small botnets comprised of about a dozen bots each. It appears that APT33 took special care to make tracking more dif.cult. The C&C domains are usually hostedon cloud hosted proxies. These proxies relay URL requests from the infected bots to backends at sharedwebservers that may host thousands of legitimate domains. The backends report bot data back to a dataaggregator and bot control server that is on a dedicated IP address. The APT33 actors connect to theseaggregators via a private VPN network with exit nodes that are changed frequently. The APT33 actors thenissue commands to the bots and collect data from the bots using these VPN connections. In fall of 2019 we counted 10 live bot data aggregating and bot controlling servers and tracked a couple ofthem for months. These aggregators get data from very few C&C servers (only 1 or 2), with only up to adozen victims per unique C&C domain. The table below lists some of the older C&C domains that are stilllive today. Domain Created suncocity.com 5/31/16 zandelshop.com 6/1/16 simsoshop.com 6/2/16 zeverco.com 6/5/16 qualitweb.com 6/6/16 service-explorer.com 3/3/17 service-norton.com 3/6/17 service-eset.com 3/6/17 service-essential.com 3/7/17 update-symantec.com 3/12/17 Table 2. APT33 C&C domains for extreme narrow targeting Figure 1. Schema showing the multiple obfuscation layers that APT33 uses Threat actors often use commercial VPN services to hide their whereabouts when administering C&C serversand doing reconnaissance. But besides using VPN services that are available for any user, we also regularlysee actors using private VPN networks that they set up for themselves. Setting up a private VPN can be easily done by renting a couple of servers from datacenters around the worldand using open source software like OpenVPN. Though the connections from private VPN networks stillcome from seemingly unrelated IP addresses around the world, this kind of traf.c is actually easier to track.Once we know that an exit node is mainly being used by a particular actor, we can have a high degree ofcon.dence about the attribution of the connections that are made from the IP addresses of the exit node. For example, besides administering C&C servers from a private VPN exit node, an actor might also be doingreconnaissance of targets¡¯ networks. APT33 likely uses its VPN exit nodes exclusively. We have been tracking some of the group¡¯s private VPNexit nodes for more than a year and we have listed known associated IP addresses in the table below. Theindicated timeframes are conservative; it is likely that the IP addresses have been used for a longer time. IP address First seen Last seen 5.135.120.57 12/4/18 1/24/195.135.199.25 3/3/19 3/3/1931.7.62.48 9/26/18 9/29/1851.77.11.46 7/1/19 7/2/1954.36.73.108 7/22/19 10/05/1954.37.48.172 10/22/19 11/05/19 54.38.124.150 10/28/18 11/17/18 88.150.221.107 9/26/19 11/07/19 91.134.203.59 9/26/18 12/4/18109.169.89.103 12/2/18 12/14/18109.200.24.114 11/19/18 12/25/18 137.74.80.220 9/29/18 10/23/18137.74.157.84 12/18/18 10/21/19185.122.56.232 9/29/18 11/4/18 185.125.204.57 10/25/18 1/14/19185.175.138.173 1/19/19 1/22/19188.165.119.138 10/8/18 11/19/18 193.70.71.112 3/7/19 3/17/19195.154.41.72 1/13/19 1/20/19213.32.113.159 6/30/19 9/16/19216.244.93.137 12/10/18 12/21/18 Table 3. IP addresses associated with a few private VPN exit nodes connected to APT33 It appears that these private VPN exit nodes are also used for reconnaissance of networks that are relevant tothe supply chain of the oil industry. More concretely, we have witnessed some of the IP addresses in Table 3doing reconnaissance on the network of an oil exploration company and military hospitals in the Middle East,as well as an oil company in the U.S.. Figure 2. APT33¡¯s usage of a private VPN network APT33 used its private VPN network to access websites of penetration testing companies, webmail, websiteson vulnerabilities, and websites related to cryptocurrencies, as well as to read hacker blogs and forums.APT33 also has a clear interest in websites that specialize in the recruitment of employees in the oil and gasindustry. We recommend companies in the oil and gas industry to cross-relate their security log .les with theIP addresses listed above. Security recommendations The continued modernization of facilities for oil, gas, water, and power is making it more dif.cult to secure them. Outright attacks, readily exploitable vulnerabilities, as well as exposed SCADA/HMI are seriousissues. Here are some of the best practices that these organizations can adopt: Establish a regular patching and update policy for all systems. Download patches as soon as possible toprevent cybercriminals from exploiting these security .aws.Improve employee awareness on the latest attack techniques that cybercriminals use. IT administrators should apply the principle of least privilege to make monitoring of inbound andoutbound traf.c easier. Install a multilayered protection system that can detect and block malicious intrusions from the gateway to the endpoint. Securing supply chains to these complex and often multinational systems is also dif.cult, as they usuallyhave necessary third-party suppliers that are embedded in their core operations. These parties may beoverlooked in terms of security, and vulnerabilities in the communication or connections with them are oftentargeted by cybercriminals.
