Attackers are compromising these enterprise networks in order to access data and eventually the networks of their clients. Information provided in this report is based on ANSSI¡¯s investigations following incident response activities. At this point, analysis suggests two waves of attacks separated in time and without technical evidence of a link between them. The .rst wave uses mainly the PlugX malware. The second wave relies on legitimate tools and credentials theft. This document focuses on the second and most recent wave and the intrusion set1 involved in it. Appendix only focuses on the PlugX malware (chapter 6). 2 Attack chain 2.1 Initial access To gain initial foothold on targeted networks, the attackers exploit vulnerabilities on low-secured services exposed on the Internet, discovered through scanning with tools like Acunetix. Other methods may also be used such as phishing emails or usage of leaked credentials. 2.2 Access and persistence To access the targeted networks after initial compromise, the attackers use legitimate VPN credentials that have probably been stolen on the victim¡¯s network. The attackers may use other methods such as installed RATs (Remote Access Tool) or other backdoors like webshells, as demonstrated during former intrusions using PlugX malwares. 2.3 Privilege escalation In order to acquire higher privileges on victim¡¯s machines, the attackers use legitimate tools such as ProcDump or Certmig (see section 3.2). Administrator accounts with a naming pattern incoherent with the usual patterns used by the victims have been observed on targeted networks (for instance an account named . aaaa .). 2.4 Lateral movement RDP connections with stolen credentials are mainly used by the attackers to move inside the compromised network, as well as Netscan commands and WMIExec scripts. 2.5 Objectives The .rst objective of the attackers seem to be the understanding of the network con.guration and its external authenticated connections to clients. After such information is acquired, the attackers move to the client network in order to gather relevant information. This information can be ex.ltrated through the service provider or the client network. 1Characteristic tools, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by one or several malicious actors accross one or several attack campaigns. It can be seen as an identity card of a threat which should not be confused with an attacker or group of attackers linked to a broader concept involving individuals and physical organisations. October 7th 2019 Page 3 of 8 2.6 Operational security Even if the sophistication of the tools used by the attackers is quite low, they are well organised in the deletion and the deactivation of all activity logs on devices they visit. Incoming connections of the attackers are anonymized through IP addresses belonging to VPN providers or TOR network. 3 Tools and malwares 3.1 Custom malware In addition to all legitimate tools described below, the attackers use a custom piece of malware they may have developped. This custom malware is designed to monitor the web browsers of a victim. This enables the gathering of credentials and session cookies. This malware communicates with a C2 server through HTTP or HTTPS. 3.2 Legitimate tools The attackers have used the following legitimate tools: . ProcDump: command-line tool used to monitor a running process and dump memory depending on custom criteria. The attackers use this tool to dump the LSASS process to gather WINDOWS credentials hashes; . CertMig: command-line tool used to import and export certi.cates on a machine. The attackers use this tool to gather credentials used for VPN authentication to the clients¡¯ networks; . WMIExec.vbs: tool used to remotely administrate a machine in VBScript with functionalities similar to Sys-Internals PsExec; . rar.exe: command-line version of the .le compression utility WINRAR. The attackers use this tool to compress, protect and split both ex.ltrated data and imported toolset; . MimiKatz: tool used for diverse actions on a WINDOWS system such as injection of libraries, process tampering and credential dumping; . Netscan: tool used to scan IPv4/IPv6 networks and remotely execute PowerShell commands. 4 Detection methods for these attackers In observed incidents, attackers have mainly used legitimate credentials and tools. IOC-based detection is therefore unefficient in this case. The following rules do not give a full certainty on the attackers presence on an information system but matching circumstances should be investigated as a potential compromise. 4.1 VPN connections 4.1.1 Source of connection The attackers mainly rely on commercial VPN services as well as the TOR network to anonymize their incoming connections. In most cases, IP addresses of VPN clients have Whois records linked to popular commercial VPN services used for web navigation (HTTP/HTTPS) and emails (SMTP/SMTPS). October 7th 2019 Page 4 of 8 However, users connecting to a company VPN through a commercial VPN exit node or a TOR node is an anomaly. Detection rule: look for incoming connections in VPN or VDI logs with a source which is an exit node in the following table. This list is not comprehensive. IP addresses  45.41.134.0/24 45.41.180.0/24 45.56.143.0/24 45.56.151.0/24 45.56.156.0/24 64.64.108.0/24 104.143.95.0/24 104.238.51.0/24 104.37.31.0/24 173.239.199.0/24  45.41.136.0/24 45.56.136.0/24 45.56.146.0/24 45.56.152.0/24 45.56.157.0/24 64.64.123.0/24 104.194.203.0/24 104.238.58.0/24 157.97.121.0/24 173.239.207.0/24  45.41.144.0/24 45.56.140.0/24 45.56.148.0/24 45.56.153.0/24 45.56.158.0/24 85.203.23.0/24 104.194.218.0/24 104.238.59.0/24 173.239.195.0/24 173.244.55.0/24  45.41.145.0/24 45.56.141.0/24 45.56.149.0/24 45.56.154.0/24 45.56.183.0/24 104.143.84.0/24 104.194.220.0/24 104.238.62.0/24 173.239.197.0/24 185.198.240.0/24  45.41.147.0/24 45.56.142.0/24 45.56.150.0/24 45.56.155.0/24 46.244.28.0/24 104.143.92.0/24 104.238.45.0/24 104.37.30.0/24 173.239.198.0/24 191.101.252.0/24  4.1.2 MAC address of the attackers In some cases, the MAC address of the source machine is recorded in VPN logs. In most cases observed during these attack campaigns, the attackers have used VMWARE virtual machines to connect to their victims. If this information is logged and depending on the usages of VMWARE inside a company, incoming connections with VMWARE MAC addresses may be linked to an attack. Detection rule: look for VPN connections with a client network interface MAC address starting with a VMWARE attributed pre.x. 00:0c:29 00:50:56 00:1C:14 00:05:69 4.1.3 Incoherent user accounts The attackers are using legitimate credentials to connect to the victim¡¯s VPN endpoint and computers. Interest.ingly, they are using different accounts for the VPN authentication and for the WINDOWS domain authentication. This is an anomaly for most companies. Looking for users using a different account for the domain authentication compared to the one used for the VPN authentication has uncovered most of the hostile connections. Detection rule: among IP addresses assigned to the VPN which are authenticating on the WINDOWS domain, look for a different identity than the one used on the VPN. 4.2 System indicators 4.2.1 Uncommon folders The attackers have mainly used two types of folders to save tools and archives. The .rst category contains folders named as antivirus software installation folders such as: . \ProgramData\ESETOEM . \ProgramData\McAfeeOEM The second category contains folders existing for most MICROSOFT WINDOWS installations but which should not contain any executables or RAR archives such as: October 7th 2019 Page 5 of 8 . \ProgramData . c:\windows\AppPatch . c:\PerfLogs and subfolders. Generally speaking, having these types of .les in these folders is an anomaly and should be investigated. Detection rule: look for executables or archives (Zip, RAR) created in folders \ProgramData\ESETOEM, \ProgramData\McAfeeOEM, \ProgramData or c:\PerfLogs. Setup of network port forwardings The attackers have used the WINDOWS .rewall to set up port forwarding between their entry point and their .nal victim. To do so, the netsh command has been used as follows: netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport =443 connectaddress =XXX .XXX .XXX .XXX connectport =443 This command will set up a forward on port TCP/443 from the compromised workstation to the target XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX on port TCP/443. When this command is executed, it will create and set a registry key. Interestingly, when the con.guration is later disabled, the key content is erased, but the key is not deleted. This kind of con.guration is rare in WINDOWS environments. Looking for machines where this key is positioned has been a reliable indicator of compromise. Detection rule: look for the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet{0,n}\services\PortProxy\v4tov4 on WIN.DOWS machines. 5 Recommendations 5.1 For service providers In order to prevent as much as possible these incidents, ANSSI recommends the following best practices to service providers and design offices: . Use secure administration methods on IT systems (ANSSI¡¯s recommendations to secure administration of IT systems); . Set up a security monitoring capability; . Make a list of connections with clients and monitor them; . Segregate clients between them. 5.2 For clients In order to prevent as much as possible these incidents, ANSSI recommends the following best practices to clients of service providers: . Use secure administration methods on IT systems (ANSSI¡¯s recommendations to secure administration of IT systems); . Set up a security monitoring capability; . Make a list of connections with service providers and monitor them; . Apply a least privilege model to accesses given to external entities (accounts, connections, trust relashion.ships). October 7th 2019 Page 6 of 8 6 Appendix: PlugX PlugX malware has only been observed during the .rst wave of attack. As a reminder, ANSSI is not able to link this phase with the second one for now. 6.1 Description PlugX is a malware family also known as KorPlug, SOGU, Scontroller, etc. The main function of this malware is to take control of a remote host. System artefacts observed show that the DLL sideloading method is used to load the malware in the host memory. 6.2 SNORT rules The following SNORT rules detect communications linked to PlugX version 2 (source : https://www.us-cert. gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A): October 7th 2019 Page 7 of 8 Version 1.0 October 7th 2019 Open License (.talab v2.0) AGENCE NATIONALE DE LA S.CURIT.
