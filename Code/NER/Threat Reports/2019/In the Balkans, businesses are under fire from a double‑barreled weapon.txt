-In the Balkans, businesses are under .re from adouble.barreled weapon welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon August 14, 2019 ESET researchers discovered a campaign that uses two malicious tools with similar capabilities to ensure both resilience and broader potential for the attackers Zuzana Hromcov¨¢ 14 Aug 2019 -11:30AM We¡¯ve discovered an ongoing campaign in the Balkans spreading two tools having a similar purpose: a backdoor and a remote access trojan we named, respectively, BalkanDoor and BalkanRAT. BalkanRAT enables the attacker to remotely control the compromised computer via a graphical interface, i.e., manually; BalkanDoor enables them to remotely control the compromised computer via a command line, i.e., possibly en masse. ESET security products detect these threats as Win{32,64}/BalkanRAT and Win32/BalkanDoor. A typical victim of this campaign, which uses malicious emails as its spreading mechanism, ends up having both these tools deployed on their computer, each of them capable of fully controlling the affected machine. This rather uncommon setup makes it possible for attackers to choose the most suitable method to instruct the computer to perform operations of their choice. The campaign¡¯s overarching theme is taxes. With the contents of the emails, included links and decoy PDFs all involving taxes, the attackers are apparently targeting the .nancial departments of organizations in the Balkans region. Thus, although backdoors and other tools for remote access are often used for espionage, we believe that this particular campaign is .nancially motivated. The campaign has been active at least from January 2016 to the time of writing (the most recent detections in our telemetry are from July 2019). Some parts of the campaign were brie.y described by a Serbian security provider in 2016 and the Croatian CERT in 2017. Each of these sources focused only on one of the two tools and only on a single country. However, our research shows that there is a signi.cant overlap in targets and also in the attackers¡¯ tactics, techniques and procedures. Our .ndings show that the mentioned attacks have been orchestrated and we consider them a single long-term campaign that spans Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our research has also shed more light at the malware used in this campaign and provided some context. We¡¯ve discovered a new version of BalkanDoor with a new method for execution/installation: an exploit of the WinRAR ACE vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250). Further, we¡¯ve seen both malicious tools digitally signed with various certi.cates the developers paid for to add perceived legitimacy. One of them, issued to SLOW BEER LTD, was even valid at the time of writing; we¡¯ve noti.ed the issuer about the misuse and they revoked the certi.cate. https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/ In this article, we will describe some notable features of both BalkanDoor and BalkanRAT. Our analysis shows that the former runs as a Windows service, which allows it to unlock the Windows logon screen remotely and without the password or start a process with the highest possible privileges. The latter misuses a legitimate remote desktop software (RDS) product and uses extra tools and scripts to hide its presence from the victim, such as hiding the window, tray icon, process and so on. Targets and distribution Both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor spread in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. (These countries, along with Slovenia and former Macedonia, formed the country of Yugoslavia until 1992.) Figure 1. Malware distribution by countryAccording to our telemetry, the campaign spreading these tools has been live since 2016, with the most recent detections as late as in July 2019. The attackers have been distributing their tools via malicious emails (¡°malspam¡±) with links leading to a malicious .le. The links included in the malspam emails used for distribution of both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor mimic legitimate websites of of.cial institutions. Malicious domain Real domain Institution pksrs[.]com pks.rs Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia porezna-porezna-Ministry of Finance of Croatia, Tax Administration uprava[.]com uprava.hr porezna.uprava[.]net pufbih[.]com pufbih.ba Tax Administration of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovinahttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/ The decoy PDFs revolve around the tax theme 8/15/2019  In the Balkans, businesses are under .re from a double-barreled weapon | WeLiveSecurity  PDF name MIP1023.pdf Ponovljeni-Stav.pdf AUG_1031.pdf Zakon.pdf ZPDG.pdf  Language Bosnian Bosnian Bosnian Croatian Serbian  Content Tax form Tax law Instructions for using tax .ling application Tax law Tax law  Most often, the links leading to an executable .le are disguised as links to a PDF. The executable .le is a WinRAR self-extractor with its name and icon changed to resemble a PDF to fool the user. When executed, it is con.gured to unpack its content, open the decoy PDF to prevent any suspicion . and silently execute either BalkanRAT or BalkanDoor. In some of the latest samples of BalkanDoor detected in 2019, the malware is distributed as an ACE archive, disguised as a RAR archive (i.e., not an executable .le), specially crafted to exploit the WinRAR ACE vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250). This vulnerability, which has been remediated thin version 5.70 released on February 28 , 2019, is known to have been exploited quite often to distribute malware. The exploit-based deployment of BalkanDoor is stealthier than in previous versions of the malware because it does not require executing the downloaded .le . an operation that might raise the intended victim¡¯s suspicions. The campaign According to our telemetry, most of the time, both tools have been deployed on the same machine. The combination of the tools gives the attacker both a command-line interface and a graphical interface to the compromised computer. In the case of the whole toolset being deployed on the machine, here is an example scenario for the attack: The attacker detects that the victim has their screen locked and thus, most probably, is not using the computer (either via BalkanDoor sending screenshot showing that computer is locked, or via the View Only mode of BalkanRAT). Via the BalkanDoor backdoor, the attacker sends a backdoor command to unlock the screenÿ and using BalkanRAT, they can do whatever they want on the computer. However, even if the victim does not use their computer, the chance of them spotting the actions performed by the attackers is still there. Even with this disadvantage, using the RDS tool may be useful. The attacker is not limited by the commands shipped in the backdoor, or by their programming skills: manually, they can perform actions that would require writing a lot of code if a backdoor was the only tool available. In principle, the Balkan-toolset could be used for espionage, among other possible goals. However, not only the campaign¡¯s targets and distribution, but also our analysis of the Balkan.toolset tools show that the attackers are going after money instead of espionage. The BalkanDoor backdoor does not implement any ex.ltration channel. Presumably, if the campaign were intended for espionage, the attackers would need an ex.ltration channel for uploading the collected data . at least as a backup to manual ex.ltration, which might not be always an option. On the contrary . and supporting the notion that the attackers¡¯ goal has been to commit some .nancial crime . we¡¯ve seen BalkanRAT dropping a tool that can list available smart cards, via the SCardListReadersA/ SCardConnectA API functions. Smart cards are usually issued by banks or governments for con.rmation of the holder¡¯s identity. If misused, smart cards can facilitate illegal/fraudulent activities, e.g. digitally signing a contract, validating a money transaction etc. https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/In the past, we¡¯ve seen this feature in Operation Buhtrap, a campaign targeting Russian banks. Analysis . BalkanDoor BalkanDoor is a simple backdoor with a small number of commands (download and execute a .le, create a remote shell, take a screenshot). It can be used to automate tasks on the compromised computer or to automatically control several affected computers at once. We have seen six versions of the backdoor, ranging in supported commands, evolving since 2016. The initial dropper unpacks all components, opens a decoy PDF (in some cases) and executes a batch installation script that ensures persistence of the backdoor. The backdoor registers itself as a service, under a legitimately-looking service name (e.g. WindowsSvc, WindowsPrnt, WindowsConn or WindowsErr); the accompanying batch scripts can further ensure persistence by using Registry Run Keys or Startup folder. After the backdoor is installed, the computer connects to a C&C server, identifying itself by the computer name and requesting the commands. The backdoor can connect to any of the C&Cs from a hardcoded list . a measure to increase resilience. It connects via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol; if HTTPS is used, then the server certi.cates are ignored. If the connection is not successful, the backdoor is capable of using the user-con.gured proxy on the victim¡¯s computer and repeating the connection attempt. The backdoor commands come in a format of an INI .le, with properties determining the commands, command arguments and intended recipients. Specifying the list of recipients allows the attacker to send their commands to several compromised computers at once, e.g. to automatically take screenshots of all compromised computers. Commands Functionality du, ra, de, rpo Download and execute a .le, in the speci.ed context and on a speci.ed desktop rip Create a remote shell accessible from the speci.ed IP address scr_int, scr_dur Capture a series of screenshots of the speci.ed duration Furthermore, the backdoor itself can be executed in several modes, determined by the command line arguments with which it is executed. These modes themselves can serve as backdoor commands (when executed from the remote shell): Argument Functionality /unlock Unlocks the screen /rcmd Creates a remote shell and redirects its input/output to the speci.ed IP address /takescr Captures a series of screenshots, duration determined by other arguments /run Executes the speci.ed command using cmd.exe /runx Executes the speci.ed command using cmd.exe, on the active (input) desktop https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon//inst Installs itself as a service and starts the main procedure (see /nosvc) /start Starts the associated service, which starts the main procedure (see /nosvc) /nosvc Main payload, communicates with C&C and interprets backdoor commands Among the BalkanDoor capabilities, the most notable is passwordless screen-unlocking. This feature comes in handy to the attackers in cases when a logged-in user locks the computer. The ¡°Lock screen¡± is just another Desktop for the system, so any malware with the necessary privileges can switch to a real desktop by command. No password is required to perform this operation. Figure 3. Code responsible for unlocking the computer when the backdoor is executed remotely with an ¡°/unlock¡± argumentAnalysis.BalkanRATThe BalkanRAT part of the malicious Balkan-toolset is more complex compared to its backdoor accomplice. Its goal is to deploy a copy of the Remote Utilities software, which is commercial software by a Russian vendor, Remote Utilities, LLC, used for remote access to a computer or for remote administration. BalkanRAT also provides the attacker with the credentials needed for this remote access. BalkanRAT has several additional components to help load, install and conceal the existence of the RDS. They can add exceptions to the .rewall, hide the RDS¡¯s window and its tray icon, and hide the presence of related processes in the task manager. Figure 4. Components used in the campaign to deploy and hide the presence of the RDS1. The dropper .rst unpacks all components; a con.guration .le, the remote desktop software and a core component installing it, a userland rootkit, a GUI hider and a decoy PDF .le. 2. The dropper opens the PDF .le so as not to arouse suspicion of the user. 3. Covertly, the dropper executes the core component (32-bit) in the installation mode. 4. The core component (32-bit) installs itself to be executed with each start, and adds exception to the .rewall for the RDS. It executes commands inst1 and inst2 speci.ed in the con.guration .le, and executes itself again, now in stealth mode. 5. In this mode, the core component acts like a keylogger. 6. The core component (32-bit) executes the 64-bit version of itself, in injection mode (if applicable). 7. The core component (64-bit) injects the userland rootkit (64-bit) into task manager processes. The userland rootkit then hides presence of the malicious processes in the task manager. 8. The core component (32-bit) executes the RDS. It repeatedly monitors and hides the RDS window (because it is a GUI application). 9. The core component (32-bit) injects the userland rootkit (32-bit) into task manager processes. The userland rootkit then hides presence of the malicious processes in the task manager. 10. The core component (32-bit) executes commands cmd1 and cmd2, as speci.ed in the con.guration .le. One of such commands was seen executing a GUI hider, which is an AutoHotKey script hiding the tray icon of the RDS. Note: Some components are optional. Also, sometimes they are deployed as a set comprising an encrypted payload and the corresponding loader. We are omitting these details. The con.guration .le of BalkanRAT is in INI .le format (similarly to BalkanDoor, which uses this format for backdoor commands), with one section named [CFG]. The INI .le is used by the malware¡¯ core component and the userland rootkit.https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/ 8/15/2019  In the Balkans, businesses are under .re from a double-barreled weapon | WeLiveSecurity  inst1, inst2 cmd1, cmd2 hproc  Commands executed by the core component during installation Command executed by the core component main payload List of processes that should be hidden by userland rootkit  mproc List of processes where userland rootkit is injected Figure 5. BalkanRAT¡¯s con.guration .le . properties (top) and example (below) BalkanRAT¡¯s core is a multipurpose component (there are both a 32-bit and a 64-bit versions); it can be executed in various modes, determined by the command-line argument. Most signi.cantly, it is used for installation of BalkanRAT, launching a userland rootkit and adding exceptions for the RDS component in the .rewall. Argu.Functionalityment /rhc Executes a batch .le /fwl Adds exception to the .rewall for the speci.ed program /sreg Sets con.guration data for the RDS in the registry (especially email address where thecredentials should be sent) /inst Ensures persistence by adding itself to the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Mi.crosoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows] registry key under the ¡°load¡± entry.

Executes the 64-bit version of itself (if applicable), injects the userland rootkit,executes the RDS and hides the window by changing its coordinates to values outside the screen. Another thread captures pressed keystrokes. The main part of the BalkanRAT malware is a copy of the Remote Utilities software for remote access. Instead of using the of.cial version, BalkanRAT deploys a copy signed by a certi.cate of the attacker. The client side of the RDS running on the victim¡¯s computer must know the unique ID and the password, both generated on the server side, to connect to the server. The RDS deployed by BalkanRAT is con.gured in such a way that the password is the same for all victims, and the generated unique ID is sent to the attacker¡¯s email address by the tool itself. Since the tool BalkanRAT misuses is legitimate, it leverages the genuine Remote Utilities¡¯ infrastructure for this communication (rutils.com, server.rutils.com); due to this, the communication may seem legitimate to the user . and to security products.https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/ As a result, the attacker has obtained credentials to access the compromised computer via the Remote Utilities software. Using this tool, they can broadcast the screen to monitor the activity of the user and manually take over the compromised computer. Figure 6. A window the victim never sees. With a legitimate copy of Remote Utilities, this window is visible; however, BalkanRAT will hide it using the GUI hider feature. To remain stealthy, BalkanRAT uses the GUI hider feature. In most samples (some older ones are an exception), it is implemented as an AutoHotKey script, compiled into an executable .le so that it can be run on a computer even if AutoHotKey is not installed there. The purpose of this script is to hide the tray icon of the RDS client. Figure 7. AutoHotKey script embedded in the resource section of the executableAnothernotablefeatureusedbyBalkanRATtostayhiddenistheabilitytohideprocessesfromtheuser.https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/14/balkans-businesses-double-barreled-weapon/ To achieve this, userland rootkit libraries are injected in processes hardcoded in the con.guration .le. The userland rootkit hooks the NtQuerySystemInformation function for the process in which it is injected. In case SystemProcessInformation is queried, it .lters out all entries for processes with the names speci.ed in the con.guration .le. As a result, conventional task manager utilities will not display the processes the attackers want to keep hidden from the user. Figure 8. With the userland rootkit injected, some processes are missing in the list (left). Without the rootkit, the processesare visible (right).Naturally, the list of processes that will be hidden contain mostly ones belonging to BalkanRAT. However, we have also seen names like ¡°weather.exe¡± or ¡°preserve.exe¡± in the list . which belong to the BalkanDoor backdoor. This .nding supports the belief these two tools are indeed used together. Conclusion Both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor have some interesting tricks up their sleeves and each of them separately pose a signi.cant risk to the victims. If used together as a toolset, they make an even more powerful weapon . the more the campaign we have discovered targets accounting, a function that is critical for organizations. The campaign targeting accountants in the Balkans shows some similarities with a campaign aimed at Ukrainian notaries reported in 2016. (The only source we have been able to .nd describing it is in Russian.) In that case, the attackers¡¯ goal was to take control over a notary computer and issue some illegal operation on behalf of the notary. Just as attackers may con.rm a fraudulent transaction on behalf of a notary, they may perform a fraudulent transaction while impersonating a manager in a company¡¯s .nancial department. To stay safe, business users . and their employers . should follow basic cybersecurity rules: be cautious about emails and scrutinize their attachments and links, keep their software updated and use a reputable security solution. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
