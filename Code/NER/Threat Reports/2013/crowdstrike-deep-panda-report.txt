All three samples provided remote access to the attacker, via two Command and Control (C2) servers.  One sample is typical of what is commonly referred to as a ¡®dropper¡¯ because its primary purpose is to write a malicious component to disk and connect it to the targeted hosts operating system. The malicious component in this case is what is commonly re.ferred to as a Remote Access Tool (RAT), this RAT is manifested as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) installed as a service. The second sample analyzed is a dual use tool that can function both as a post exploitation tool used to infect other systems, download additional tools, remove log data, and itself be used as a backdoor.  The third sample was a sophisticated implant that in addition to having multiple communication capabilities, and the ability to act as a relay for other infected hosts, utilized a kernel mode driver that can hide aspects of the tool from user-mode tools. This third component is likely used for long-term implantation and intelligence gathering. Some AV engines occasionally identify this sample as Derusbi Trojan.  CrowdStrike Intelligence Team has seen Trojans from 8 different builder variants of this RAT, including 64-bit versions, used in targeted attacks in 2011 against Defense, Energy/Power, and Chemical Industries in US and Japan.  target various strategic interests of the United States including High Tech/Heavy Industry, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), State/Federal Government, Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and organizations with vast economic interests. This report contains an in-depth technical analysis of the samples, detection/remediation/mitigation information, attribution intelligence, and a conclusion aimed at providing the reader with a synopsis of the report. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS Dropper Sample (MD5: 14c04f88dc97aef3e9b516ef208a2bf5) The executable 14c04f88dc97aef3e9b516ef208a2bf5 is commonly referred to as a ¡®dropper¡¯, which is designed with the purpose of extracting from itself a malicious payload and to initialize and install it into a targeted system. In this case, the malicious payload is a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), which enables an attacker to have full control of the system. This code appears to have been compiled on Wednesday May 4th, 2011 at 11:04:24 A.M. UTC (equivalent to early evening time in China).

This code appears to have been compiled on Wednesday May 4th, 2011 at 10:48:19 A.M. UTC (equivalent to early evening time in China).  It is instantiated when it is mapped   service despite the appearance. If the service is present, the malware replaces its previous instances or versions of this backdoor. After attempting to disable the existing service, the malware tries to install itself as a service with that same name. During installation, the sample attempts to use documented APIs such as OpenSCManager() and CreateService() to initialize itself as a persistent Windows service. As a precaution, the sample writes settings directly to the Windows Registry to accomplish the same goal if installing the service with the documented APIs fails.  The registry change creates the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\msupdate\\Parameters Following this, the subroutine will set the value of the ¡®ServiceDLL¡¯ to the module handle of the DLL. The next key to be changed is: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost, which will have the ¡®msupdate¡¯ key set to ¡®msupdate¡¯. The export ¡®CollectW3PerfData¡¯ is registered as the main function of the DLL. If the installation of the new service is successful, the sample then starts the new service and exits. If the installation fails, the sample  exported function. In the case of installation failure, rundll32.exe calls the main functions export   over the machine, as rundll32.exe is frequently launched by tasks such as changing the time, wallpaper, or other system settings. This means that after cleaning up the components dropped by the malware, the system remains vulnerable to local attacks by simply overwriting the legitimate rundll32.exe executable with a malicious version and await it¡¯s automatic execution by the Operating System.  Window with class ¡°NOD32_%d¡± where %d is replaced with a pseudo-random number. This may be an attempt to fool some automated dynamic analysis or anti-malware software into believing this is the  After creating this window, the routine starts the main thread that eventually initiates calling out to the Command and Control (C2). In order to accomplish this task, the newly created thread initializes networking APIs using WSAStartup() and resolves some other APIs dynamically using LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress(). Once the proper API¡¯s have been resolved, the sample then assigns a NULL SID to the rundll32.exe executable and sets the current process¡¯ Window Station to ¡°winsta0¡±, which enables the sample to access the real user¡¯s desktop if started as service. The communication to the C2 is handled by a while() loop, with each successive connection attempt causing the loop to invoke the Windows Sleep() API for a  time interval of 2 seconds, exponentially increasing in length up to 1024 seconds (17 minutes) and then restarting back to 2 seconds. Initial C2 Phone Home Beacon   in the binary, using the User-Agent string ¡°Google¡±, this code is not activated due to the format of the stat. a raw socket to the C2 located at 1.9.5.38:443. This indicates the use of a ¡®boiler plate code¡¯ or a builder software package that automates the creation of the malicious sample. The malicious sample sends an initial beacon to the C2 that includes the following information: ,  Desktop session or ¡°none¡± otherwise. , H O % V .  The following python function can be used to decode the beacon stings: def decode(crypted):decoded=¡±¡± for x in crypted:decoded+=chr(((ord(x)^(0x1C +1)) + (0x1C +1)) & 0xFF)return decoded When command 0x23000004 is received, a temporary new user ¡°_DomainUser_¡± with password ¡°Dom4!nU.serP4ss¡± is created and added to the local Administrators group. The backdoor is then started under that account and the user is deleted. It would appear this technique is meant to obfuscate the activities of the malicious sample by masking the process creator¡¯s user name to appear to be a generic domain user. Note that such an account does not normally exist in an Active Directory environment. Additionally, the primary C2 connection allows for requests to start additional connections to the C2 imple.menting the following functionality:  killing of running processes  output of arbitrary executables; initiated by command 0x23000000 U V V ,   Post Exploitation Tool Sample (MD5:  2dce7fc3f52a692d8a84a0c182519133) This sample is typical of a post exploitation tool; it is written in .NET 2.0. This code appears to have been compiled on Thursday May 26th, 2011 at 10:21:44 A.M. UTC (early evening time in China). The backdoor functionality can be instantiated either directly from the command line or through commands issued over a network based protocol via the C2. If no arguments are given, a connection to the C2 is initiated to the stati.  C2.    line arguments can be viewed in Appendix A.  This activity is generally associated with log cleaning to com.plicate a forensic investigation. The sample contains an embedded IP address for C2 that is stored in an encrypted format as a string re.source: . Variants of this Trojan are sometimes detected under the name ¡®Derusbi¡¯ by Microsoft, Trend, Sophos and Symantec AV engines. This sample is a DLL which can be registered as a service and is used to drop a kernel driver and provide an interactive command line shell to the C2. It also is able to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to install itself by using the ¡®sysprep.exe¡¯ Microsoft Windows executable provided by the targeted system. The steps it takes to install itself onto a system are as follows: 1. Copies itself to to %WINDIR%\system32\Msres<3 random characters>.ttf  the current system time when the copy was made but with the year changed to 2005.      MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\<service>¡± This defaults to ¡°wuauserv¡±,  4. Adds itself to list of services started by ¡®netsvc¡¯ using the service name ¡®helpsvc¡¯. 5. If McAfee AV is installed, creates a copy of regsvr32.exe named Update.exe and then schedules     the copy to be deleted on reboot using the well documented MoveFileExA API. 6. It then calls either the original or copy of regsvr32.exe with the parameters /s /u and the path to     the copy of itself it made in Step 1. The /u parameter means ¡°uninstall¡±, which calls      DllUnregisterServer, this is an unsophisticated method of DLL entry point obfuscation. 7. DllUnregisterServer installs the driver and initiates the backdoor component.  exe¡± is running (AntiVirus360 program from the Chinese ¡®Quihoo 360 Technology Co., LTD¡¯ 360 ), or the username of the DLL¡¯s host process context is not ¡®SYSTEM¡¯, the driver is not written to disk.  Barring the two aforementioned conditions, the sample decrypts the kernel driver to: ¡°%sysdir%\Drivers\{6AB5E732-DFA9-4618-AF1C-F0D9DEF0E222}.sys¡± . hash of dae6b9b3b8e39b08b10a51a6457444d8. U ¡°HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\Security¡±    code.  the backdoor then loads the original service¡¯s DLL into the address space with LoadLibrary and invokes the ServiceMain export. This effectively hijacks the original service¡¯s entry while retaining its functionality. While there is code in the binary that allows downloading a list of C2 servers from an HTTP URL, the default  the one used by the post exploitation .NET tool. C2 Communication Mechanisms The malware has three distinct C2 protocols two of which can be transmitted over HTTP proxies and one can be bundled in two different ¡®dual¡¯ modes (see 3.), totaling 7 distinct supported C2 mechanisms. The con.    1. Proprietary binary header (optionally over an HTTP Proxy using CONNECT mechanism); this      protocol consists of 64 random bytes being sent to the C2. The C2 then responds with 64 bytes   bytes rotated right by seven bits and compares that value to the seven bits rotated right version of     the server¡¯s response, effectively neutralizing the rotation¡¯s effect; the purpose of this is unclear.      request string including HTTP headers (optionally over a HTTP Proxy using CONNECT). The malware requires the response to start with ¡°HTTP/1.0 200¡± or ¡°HTTP/1.1 200¡± and an absence of     a ¡°Connection: close¡± header. This one HTTP connection will be used for bi-directional      communications, sending chunks of POST payload and receiving chunks of the response, interleaved. 3. Two long-running HTTP requests to the same C2 (optionally over an HTTP Proxy with original      request verb), one GET request to ¡°/Photos/Query.cgi?loginid=¡± followed by a random number     and one POST request to ¡°/Catelog/login1.cgi¡±. The GET request serves as a down-stream      channel while the POST request serves as a upstream channel.  legitimate appearing channels as required in order to appear Request For Comment (RFC) compliant with the HTTP protocol.    due to time constraints. After establishing any of the aforementioned channels for arbitrary binary data exchange, the malware will start sending and receiving compressed binary blobs via the channel of choice. The C2¡¯s binary data blobs are compressed. No further encryption of the data takes place. All C2 transport implementations contain code for accepting and handling server-side connections of the respective protocols. However, this code does not appear to be invoked. It appears that the author of this code shares the library that implements these transports for the client with the C2 server. C2 Command Invocation The main backdoor thread then reads commands from the chosen C2 protocol and passes them on to any of the following registered handler classes based upon a command ID. The handler class is responsible for parsing the remainder of the command. Q     PCC_PROXY: TCP Proxy This handler class implements a generic TCP proxy. It supports establishing TCP connections to other hosts and also listening for incoming connections. The incoming connection contents are forwarded to the C2 and data from the C2 is passed on to connections. It supports up to 1024 parallel connections. PCC_MISC : Gather and report system information The malware is capable of gathering various pieces of information from the system, triggered by a command ID 10. The capabilities include recovering authentication credentials from various system and client storage such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Remote Access Service (RAS).  This class also supports gathering intelligence on the infected system including identifying security tools by their process name, proxy accounts, and version numbers for the Operating System (OS) and Internet Explorer.  PCC_SYS: System Management This handler class provides the attacker with the ability to manage system components including start/stop/ delete system services, enumerate/alter registry keys, and manage running processes. This class also provides the ability for the attacker to take a screen shot of the users desktop. INTERNAL_CMD: Command-Line Shell This handler class uses the command ID 5 and implements an interactive command line shell accessible from the C2 server, containing a series of built-in commands. If the input is not in this list of built-in commands, the malware attempts to invoke cmd.exe in the background, launching a command or command line utility already present on the system. The standard output channel of that command is provided back to the C2. The supported built-in commands are: V G U G G O \ Q H V G G W @ @ @ W O Kill Switch / Self-Destruction The only command that is implemented directly in the main backdoor thread as a subprocedure call and not via a generic command handler class is command ID 256. This command results in the DLL deleting itself and terminating the backdoor process. Kernel Driver Sample (MD5: dae6b9b3b8e39b08b10a51a6457444d8) This sample is a packed 32-bit kernel driver extracted by the aforementioned DLL with an MD5 hash of: de7500fc1065a081180841f32f06a537, this sample will only function on a Windows 32-bit kernel. This code appears to have been compiled on Sunday October 9, 2011 at 4:50:31 P.M.  UTC (very early morning time of Monday, October 10 in China). Entrypoint This section describes how the driver performs its initialization routine. Multiple Instance Protection The driver begins by opening a named event in the BaseNamedObjects object directory with the name  exists, the driver fails to load, presumably to avoid a multiple instances of itself. If the event does not exist, the driver then creates it using the Windows API   and indicative of relatively limited Windows API knowledge of the author of that part of the code.  It is interesting to note that some of the hex digits in the object name are mixed case which is potentially indicative of the code being re-appropriated from another source. Anti-Debugging Protection The second component of the entry point performs an anti-debugging technique, calling the function KdDisableDebugger(), which allows the driver to disable usage of the built-in Windows kernel debugging facility that is used by popular kernel debuggers KD and WinDbg. Tools such as Syser Debugger, or debugging through a virtual machine are unaffected by this technique. The sample, rather than importing the KdDisableDebugger() API using conventional methods, looks up the API through MmGetSystemRoutineAddress() instead. All of the other APIs used by the driver are imported normally, so this is not a technique to hide import APIs used throughout the driver. Searching Google for ¡°MmGetSystemRoutineAddress¡± and ¡°KdDisableDebugger¡± results in dozens of Chinese language blogs which explain how to use this technique to ¡°Disable WinDbg¡±. Hooking  is designed to hook the system call table, while the other hooks the network stack. Network Stack Hooking  the version is necessary because Windows versions beginning with Vista utilize a redesigned TCP/IP net.work stack, most hooking operations will require a different implementation for these versions. On versions prior to Windows Vista, the TCP/IP driver creates a \Device\Tcp device object through which most network requests are piped through. On Vista and later, TCP/IP has been split up into multiple components, and IP connection enumeration, which this driver is targeting, is managed by \Device\nsiproxy instead. In either case, the driver obtains the device object by using IoGetDeviceObjectPointer() and hooks Major Function 14 the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL, as this is the function through which all Input Output ConTroLls (IOCTLs) are sent, such as the IOCTL for querying active IP connections. Network Store Interface (NSI) Hook The NSI hook, targets IOCTL 0x12001B, which is used by NsiGetObjectAllParameters() in nsi.dll when users typically run commands such as netstat.exe or use any of the IP Helper APIs in iphlpapi.dll. The purpose of the hook is to scan the list of active connections returned to the user, and hide any such connection currently bound to a local TCP port in the range between 40000 and 45000. The hooking is performed by creating a new completion routine associated with any IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL IRP that matches the IOCTL, attaching to the target process, performing several memory copies to hide the entry, and detaching. This functionality is nearly identical to the code posted by Edward Sun (aka cardmagic, sunmy1@sina.com, onlyonejazz@hotmail.com, cardcian@mail.ustc.edu.cn, QQ# 28025945) from Hefei, Anhui province (Nanjing Military District) on July 8, 2007, then a China-based researcher at Trend Micro (now working at at http://forum.eviloctal.com/viewthread.php?action=printable&tid=29604 (See Appendix G).  CrowdStrike has no information connecting Mr. Sun to this intrusion activity, his code appears to have been appropriated by the actor to add similar functionality to their code. TCP Hook The TCP hook works almost identically to the NSI hook, though instead hooking IOCTL 0x120003 (IOCTL_   any connections listening on TCP ports in the range between 40000 and 45000. System Call Hooking   DWORD at each of these exported functions. Because the system call stub uses the EAX register as an index for the system call ID, and a ¡°mov eax, imm32¡± instruction¡± instruction is used, this second DWORD will match the system call ID. It then adds this index to the value of KeServiceDescriptorTable.Base, which is the exported kernel variable (on 32-bit Windows only) which directly points to the system call table. This is one of the simplest ways to do a system call hook, but will not work on 64-bit Windows as this variable is not exported in addition to the protection provided by Microsoft PatchGuard.  Windows API IoAllocateMdl(), and associating the MDL to a non-paged buffer using MmBuildMdlForNonPagedPool(). Once the MDL is associated to the non-paged buffer, the sample locks the underlying pages using the Windows API MmProbeAndLockPages(). Instead of hooking the entry in the table directly, which is easily detectable, the driver uses the LDASM open-source disassembly engine to analyze the function that is being pointed to by the table, and applying a Detours-style hook directly in the code. It uses the standard ¡°mov cr0, eax¡± technique, turning off the Write Protect (WP) bit as it does this. When the hook is installed, it writes a special DWORD value, ¡®KDTR¡¯, which allows it to prevent double-hooking or badly-hooking the system call, during unhooking, this value is also checked. Registry Hooks \\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SYSTEM is blocked. RegSaveKey() which is  backup of a particular registry key.  \\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\. It then checks for the values of the ¡°ServiceDll¡± and ¡°Security¡± keys, in the latter case it applies an XOR on the data with the value 127. The user-mode component of this malware is a service called ¡°msupdate¡±, this driver is attempting to hide the     key, due to the fact that these APIs provide almost identical functionality when it comes to reading registry values. In the registry hooking code of the driver, a call is made to ObReferenceObjectByHandle().  This allows the driver to receive the ¡®CM_KEY_OBJECT¡¯ which is then used with ObQueryNameString() to get the key/value path. However, no call to ObDereferenceObject() is ever made, which means that all registry objects being sent to these APIs are eventually leaked. In the registry hook, it was noticed that ¡°CurrentControlSet001¡± was used as the target, if the target machine  function as intended. This is the reason the Microsoft implemented a symbolic link to \\CurrentControlSet  MITIGATION / REMEDIATION   Network Signatures The following network signatures are designed for the popular Open Source IDS called Snort.

Compiler artifacts and language settings can of course be deliberately masked or spoofed. CrowdStrike uses a unique approach of comprehensive threat analysis in order to decipher attributable components. Based on the corroborating evidence discovered in the course of this analysis, it appears there are numerous indications that this is a Chinese-speaking actor.   , a Chinese security product available from http://www.360.cn/. This is particularly relevant in this case because the backdoor DLL sample with an MD5  this tool. Speculatively this may be because this security product detects this rootkit, or the author was attempting to prevent accidental infection on systems running this Anti-Virus product. The obfuscation of the KdDisableDebugger() function call is seen on several Chinese language forums, and can be seen being reused in several code samples on those forums. As previously mentioned there is no advantage associated with using this call obfuscation, and appears to be reused for no apparent reason other than the attackers have copied code directly from forum code. While the various network hooking techniques used in the kernel driver may appear novel or well  ¡®rootkit.com¡¯ by a Chinese language developer.

The ldasm inline hooking is also repeated in numerous postings to Chinese forums.

(http://www.likego.com/en/about.asp), a company that builds  however was used by whomever built the kernel driver utilized by the backdoor and for this reason we are providing the background on this individual. CONCLUSION The samples involved in this incident are typical of attacks commonly associated with the People¡¯s Republic of China (PRC). These code samples have a variety of Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)   The ability to conduct Incident Response (IR) including forensics, and log analysis, greatly augments this visibility into these aspects of the incident. Some indications as to the adversaries¡¯ capabilities can be derived from the captured samples alone. Dropper/Implant #1 The dropper code (MD5: 14c04f88dc97aef3e9b516ef208a2bf5) does not utilize any techniques that are unique or unusual, and is consistent with tools, techniques, and procedures of attacks targeting proprietary information and generally attributed to the PRC. The presence of dead code and its replacement by a more  side. The ¡®dead code¡¯ utilizes a more sophisticated compression algorithm provided by a third party which was rendered useless for some reason. This may have been a result of the attacker modifying an existing tool, or unknowingly using a re-purposed tool. The dropper resources indicate the compiler used to build the tool was running on a system that utilized the Chinese ¡°Simple¡± language pack and was built on Wednesday May 4th, 2011 at 11:04:24 A.M. UTC (early evening time in China).  While this can be deliberately spoofed  speaking actor.  The dropped DLL (MD5: 47619fca20895abc83807321cbb80a3d) itself contains functionality that is typical  . encryption/obfuscation using a statically compiled XOR key.  The sample uses TCP port 443 for commu.nication, but makes no attempt to mimic the SSL protocol typically used on that port number, which would provide enhanced Operational Security (OPSEC). This code appears to have been compiled on Wednes.day May 4th, 2011 at 10:48:19 A.M. UTC (early evening time in China). Post Exploitation Tool The post exploitation tool (MD5: 2dce7fc3f52a692d8a84a0c182519133) is a dual-use tool, it can be dropped and executed by a client-side exploit, or the adversary can launch it using a variety of command line options. This tool is built in Microsoft .NET framework, which is typically an indication of a less sophis.ticated attacker, because .NET is easier to develop in but requires the .NET framework be present on the victim machine. The tool appears to have been compiled on Thursday May 26th, 2011 at 10:21:44 A.M. UTC (early evening time in China). The sample utilizes the AES cryptographic algorithm to protect its C2 communications. Implant #2 Backdoor DLL This DLL is a moderately sophisticated backdoor with several well designed communication mechanisms not typically seen in these types of implants. The code base for the sample was developed in C++. The code appears to have been compiled on Sunday October 30, 2011 at 12:43:33 P.M. UTC (late evening time in China). This sample has multiple communication capabilities available that makes it far more versatile and stealthy.  It implements relatively well thought out protocols including HTTP and DNS.  The tool has the ability to automatically down select the most effective communication channel once it has been instantiated, which can help avoid detection from solutions like DNS blacklisting and RFC protocol enforcement. The DLL itself contains traces of the original C++ class names that were utilized in the source code, which in   communicating to the C2, thus enhancing OPSEC. The sample contains ¡®dead code¡¯ which appears to be command and control server classes, this is likely an indicator that the C2 client which would communicate with this sample shares the same communications library which was compiled into this sample. System Driver The kernel driver component dropped by the Backdoor DLL bears many tool marks associating it with the CCRootkit package publicly by Steven Lai (a/k/a embedlinux). This kernel mode rootkit implements several hooking techniques that are aimed at preventing a system administrator from detecting the backdoor DLL. The implementation of these techniques has some unique idiosyncrasies that permit direct attribution to the source code Steven Lai posted. This driver attempts to hide a wide swath of TCP ports (40000-45000) for an unknown reason, however it is suspected that this may relate to the potential network relaying capability alluded to for the backdoor dll. System Driver The kernel driver component dropped by the Backdoor DLL bears many tool marks associating it with the CCRootkit package publicly by Steven Lai (a/k/a embedlinux).
