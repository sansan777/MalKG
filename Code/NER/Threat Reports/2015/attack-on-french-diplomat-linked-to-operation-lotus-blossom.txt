TAGGED: 
AutoFocus,

Emissary, 
Lotus 
Blossom, 
spearphishing 


We 
observed 
a 
targeted 
attack 
in 
November 
directed 
at 
an 
individual 
working 
for 
the 
French 
Ministry 
of 
ForeignAffairs. 
The 
attack 
involved 
a 
spear-phishing 
email 
sent 
to 
a 
single 
French 
diplomat 
based 
in 
Taipei, 
Taiwan 
and 
contained 
an 
invitation 
to 
a 
Science 
and 
Technology 
support 
group 
event. 


The 
actors 
attempted 
to 
exploit 
CVE-2014-6332 
using 
a 
slightly 
modified 
version 
of 
the 
proof-ofconcept 
(POC) 
code 
to 
install 
a 
Trojan 
called 
Emissary, 
which 
is 
related 
to 
the 
Operation 
Lotus 
Blossom 
campaign. 
The 
TTPs 
used 
in 
this 
attack 
also 
match 
those 
detailed 
in 
the 
paper. 
The 
targeting 
of 
this 
individual 
suggests 
the 
actors 
are 
interested 
in 
breaching 
the 
French 
Ministry 
of 
ForeignAffairs 
itself 
or 
gaining 
insights 
into 
relations 
between 
France 
and 
Taiwan. 


We 
have 
created 
theEmissary 
tag 
forAutoFocus 
users 
to 
track 
this 
threat. 



On 
November 
10, 
2015, 
threat 
actors 
sent 
a 
spear-phishing 
email 
to 
an 
individual 
at 
the 
French 
Ministry 
of 
ForeignAffairs. 
The 
subject 
and 
the 
body 
of 
the 
email 
suggest 
the 
targeted 
individual 
had 
been 
invited 
to 
a 
Science 
and 
Technology 
conference 
in 
Hsinchu, 
Taiwan. 
The 
e-mail 
appears 
quite 
timely, 
as 
the 
conference 
was 
held 
on 
November 
13, 
2015, 
which 
is 
three 
days 
after 
the 
attack 
took 
place. 


The 
email 
body 
contained 
a 
link 
to 
the 
legitimate 
registration 
page 
for 
the 
conference, 
but 
the 
email 
also 
had 
two 
attachments 
with 
the 
following 
filenames 
that 
also 
pertain 
to 
the 
conference: 


1.蔡英⽂柯建銘全國科技後援會邀請函 
.doc 
(translates 
to 
“Tsai 
Ker 
Chien-ming 
National 
Science 
and 
Technology 
SupportAssociation 
invitations.doc”) 


2.書⾯報名表格.doc 
(translates 
to 
“WrittenApplication 
Form.doc”) 
Both 
attachments 
are 
malicious 
Word 
documents 
that 
attempt 
to 
exploit 
the 
Windows 
OLE 
AutomationArray 
Remote 
Code 
Execution 
Vulnerability 
tracked 
by 
CVE-2014-6332. 
Upon 
successful 
exploitation, 
the 
attachments 
will 
install 
a 
Trojan 
named 
Emissary 
and 
open 
a 
Word 
document 
as 
a 
decoy. 


The 
first 
attachment 
opens 
a 
decoy 
(Figure 
2) 
that 
is 
a 
copy 
of 
an 
invitation 
to 
a 
Science 
and 
Technology 
conference 
this 
past 
November 
13th 
held 
in 
Hsingchu, 
Taiwan, 
while 
the 
second 
opens 
a 
decoy 
(Figure 
1) 
that 
is 
a 
registration 
form 
to 
attend 
the 
conference. 
The 
conference 
was 
widely 
advertised 
online 
and 
on 
Facebook, 
however 
in 
this 
case 
the 
invitation 
includes 
a 
detailed 
itinerary 
that 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
appeared 
online. 
The 
Democratic 
Progressive’s 
Party 
(DPP) 
Chairwoman 
Tsai 
Ing-wen 
and 
DPP 
caucus 
whip 
and 
Hsinchu 
representative 
Ker 
Chien-ming 
were 
the 
primary 
political 
sponsors 
of 
the 
conference 
and 
are 
longtime 
political 
allies. 
Tsai 
Ing-wen 
is 
the 
current 
front-runner 
for 
the 
Taiwanese 
Presidency 
and 
Ker 
Chien-ming 
may 
become 
Speaker 
if 
she 
wins. 
The 
conference 
focused 
on 
using 
open 
source 
technology, 
open 
international 
recruiting, 
and 
partnerships 
to 
continue 
developing 
Hsinchu 
as 
the 
Silicon 
Valley 
of 
Taiwan. 
It 
particularly 
noted 
France 
as 
an 
ally 
in 
this, 
and 
France 
is 
Taiwan’s 
second 
largest 
technology 
partner 
and 
fourth 
largest 
trading 
partner 
in 
Europe.

The 
threat 
actors 
attempted 
to 
exploit 
CVE-2014-6332 
using 
the 
POC 
code 
available 
in 
the 
wild. 
The 
POC 
code 
contains 
inline 
comments 
that 
explain 
how 
the 
malicious 
VBScript 
exploits 
this 
vulnerability, 
so 
instead 
of 
discussing 
the 
malicious 
script 
or 
exploit 
itself, 
we 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
portions 
of 
the 
script 
that 
the 
threat 
actors 
modified. 


The 
actors 
removed 
the 
explanatory 
comments 
from 
the 
VBScript 
and 
made 
slight 
modifications 
to 
the 
POC 
code. 
The 
only 
major 
functional 
difference 
between 
the 
POC 
and 
the 
VBScript 
involved 
adding 
the 
ability 
to 
extract 
and 
run 
both 
a 
decoy 
document 
and 
payload. 
Figure 
3 
and 
4 
compare 
the 
differing 
“runshell” 
command 
within 
the 
POC 
and 
the 
malicious 
documents 
used 
in 
this 
attack. 
The 
code 
in 
Figure 
3 
shows 
that 
the 
POC 
does 
nothing 
more 
than 
launch 
the 
notepad.exe 
application 
upon 
successful 
exploitation. 
Figure

shows 
the 
malicious 
document 
creating 
a 
file 
named 
“ss.vbs” 
that 
it 
writes 
a 
VBScript 
to 
using 
a 
series 
of 
“echo” 
statements. 
After 
writing 
the 
VBScript, 
the 
malicious 
document 
executes 
the 
“ss.vbs” 
file.

The 
ss.vbs 
file 
is 
responsible 
for 
locating 
the 
payload 
and 
decoy 
document 
from 
the 
initial 
malicious 
document, 
as 
well 
as 
decrypting, 
saving 
and 
opening 
both 
of 
the 
files. 
The 
script 
has 
hardcoded 
offsets 
to 
the 
location 
of 
both 
the 
payload 
and 
decoy 
document 
within 
the 
initial 
document. 
The 
script 
will 
decrypt 
both 
of 
the 
embedded 
files 
using 
a 
two-byte 
XOR 
loop 
that 
skips 
the 
first 
byte 
and 
then 
decrypts 
the 
remaining 
using 
“A” 
and 
“C” 
as 
the 
key.After 
decrypting 
the 
embedded 
files, 
the 
script 
saves 
the 
decoy 
to 
“t.doc” 
and 
the 
payload 
to 
“mm.dll” 
in 
the 
“%APPDATA%\LocalData” 
folder. 
Finally, 
the 
script 
will 
open 
the 
decoy 
document 
and 
launch 
the 
payload 
by 
calling 
its 
exported 
function 
named 
“Setting”.

payload 
of 
this 
attack 
is 
a 
Trojan 
that 
we 
track 
with 
the 
name 
Emissary. 
This 
Trojan 
is 
related 
to 
the 
Elise 
backdoor 
described 
in 
the 
Operation 
Lotus 
Blossomreport. 
Both 
Emissary 
and 
Elise 
are 
part 
of 
a 
malware 
group 
referred 
to 
as 
“LStudio”, 
which 
is 
based 
on 
the 
following 
debug 
strings 
found 
in 
Emissary 
and 
Elise 
samples: 


d:\lstudio\projects\worldclient\emissary\Release\emissary\i386\emissary.pdb 


d:\lstudio\projects\lotus\elise\Release\EliseDLL\i386\EliseDLL.pdb 


There 
is 
code 
overlap 
between 
Emissary 
and 
Elise, 
specifically 
in 
the 
use 
of 
a 
common 
function 
to 
log 
debug 
messages 
to 
a 
file 
and 
a 
custom 
algorithm 
to 
decrypt 
the 
configuration 
file. 
The 
custom 
algorithm 
used 
by 
Emissary 
and 
Elise 
to 
decrypt 
their 
configurations 
use 
the 
“srand” 
function 
to 
set 
a 
seed 
value 
for 
the 
“rand” 
function, 
which 
the 
algorithm 
uses 
to 
generate 
a 
key. 
While 
the 
“rand” 
function 
is 
meant 
to 
generate 
random 
numbers, 
the 
malware 
author 
uses 
the 
“srand” 
function 
to 
seed 
the 
“rand” 
function 
with 
a 
static 
value. 
The 
static 
seed 
value 
causes 
the 
“rand” 
function 
to 
create 
the 
same 
values 
each 
time 
it 
is 
called 
and 
results 
in 
a 
static 
key 
to 
decrypt 
the 
configuration. 
The 
seed 
value 
is 
where 
the 
Emissary 
and 
Elise 
differ 
in 
their 
use 
of 
this 
algorithm, 
as 
Emissary 
uses 
a 
seed 
value 
of 
1024 
(as 
seen 
in 
Figure 
6) 
and 
Elise 
uses 
the 
seed 
value 
of 
2012.

While 
these 
two 
Trojans 
share 
code, 
we 
consider 
Emissary 
and 
Elise 
separate 
tools 
since 
their 
configuration 
structure, 
command 
handler 
and 
C2 
communications 
channel 
differ. 
The 
Emissary 
Trojan 
delivered 
in 
this 
attack 
contains 
the 
components 
listed 
in 
Table 
1. 
At 
a 
high 
level, 
Emissary 
has 
an 
initial 
loader 
DLLthat 
extracts 
a 
configuration 
file 
and 
a 
second 
DLLcontaining 
Emissary’s 
functional 
code 
that 
it 
injects 
into 
Internet

in 
attack 
on 
French 
Ministry 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs 


The 
loader 
Trojan 
named 
“ishelp.dll” 
had 
an 
original 
name 
of 
“Loader.dll”, 
which 
will 
extract 
the 
Emissary 
payload 
from 
a 
resource 
named 
“asdasdasdasdsad” 
and 
write 
it 
to 
a 
file 
named 
“A08E81B411.DAT”. 
The 
loader 
will 
then 
write 
an 
embedded 
configuration 
to 
a 
file 
named 
“75BD50EC.DAT”. 
The 
loader 
Trojan 
creates 
a 
mutex 
named 
“_MICROSOFT_LOADER_MUTEX_” 
and 
finishes 
by 
injecting 
the 
Emissary 
DLL 
in 
“A08E81B411.DAT” 
into 
a 
newly 
spawned 
Internet 
Explorer 
process. 


The 
Emissary 
Trojan 
runs 
within 
the 
Internet 
Explorer 
process. 
It 
begins 
by 
reading 
and 
decrypting 
its 
configuration 
file, 
which 
has 
the 
following 
structure: 


123456789101112structemissary_config{

CHAR[128]Server2;
CHAR[128]Server3;
CHAR[128]CampaignName;
CHAR[550]Unknown2;

};
We 
decrypted 
and 
parsed 
the 
configuration 
file 
that 
accompanied 
the 
payload 
used 
in 
this 
attack, 
which 
resulted 
in 
the 
following 
settings:

After 
decrypting 
the 
configuration 
file, 
Emissary 
interacts 
with 
its 
command 
and 
control 
(C2) 
servers 
using 
HTTP 
or 
HTTPS, 
depending 
on 
the 
protocol 
specified 
in 
the 
configuration 
file. 
The 
initial 
network 
beacon 
sent 
from 
Emissary 
to 
its 
C2 
server, 
seen 
in 
Figure 
7, 
includes 
a 
Cookie 
field 
that 
contains 
a 
“GUID”, 
“op” 
and 
“SHO” 
field. 
The 
GUID 
field 
is 
a 
unique 
identifier 
for 
the 
compromised 
system 
that 
is 
obtained 
directly 
from 
the 
configuration 
file. 
The 
op 
field 
has 
a 
value 
of 
“101”, 
which 
is 
a 
static 
value 
that 
represents 
the 
initial 
network 
beacon. 
The 
SHO 
field 
contains 
the 
external 
IP 
address 
of 
the 
infected 
system, 
which 
Emissary 
obtains 
from 
a 
legitimate 
website 
“showip.net”, 
specifically 
parsing 
the 
website’s 
response 
for 
‘<input 
id=”checkip” 
type=”text” 
name=”check_ip” 
value=’, 
which 
contains 
the 
IP 
address 
of 
the 
system.

The 
C2 
server 
response 
to 
this 
beacon 
(seen 
in 
Figure 
8) 
will 
contain 
a 
header 
field 
called 
“Set



Cookie”, 
which 
contains 
a 
value 
of 
“SID”. 
The 
SID 
value 
is 
base64 
encoded 
and 
encrypted 
using 
a 
rolling 
XOR 
algorithm, 
which 
once 
decoded 
and 
decrypted 
contains 
a 
36-character 
GUID 
value. 
The 
Emissary 
Trojan 
will 
use 
this 
GUID 
value 
provided 
by 
the 
C2 
server 
as 
an 
encryption 
key 
that 
it 
will 
use 
to 
encrypt 
data 
sent 
in 
subsequent 
network 
communications.

beacon 


The 
C2 
server 
provides 
commands 
to 
the 
Trojan 
as 
a 
three 
digit 
numeric 
string 
within 
the 
data 
portion 
of 
the 
HTTP 
response 
(in 
the 
form 
of 
“op=<command>”), 
which 
the 
Emissary 
Trojan 
will 
decrypt 
and 
compare 
to 
a 
list 
of 
commands 
within 
its 
command 
handler. 
The 
command 
handler 
function 
within 
the 
Emissary 
Trojan 
supports 
six 
commands, 
as 
seen 
in 
Table 
2.

If 
the 
command 
issued 
from 
the 
C2 
server 
does 
not 
match 
the 
one 
listed 
in 
the 
Trojan 
saves 
the 
message 
“unkown:%s” 
to 
the 
log 
file. 
The 
command 
set 
available 
within 
Emissary 
allows 
the 
threat 
actors 
backdoor 
access 
to 
a 
compromised 
system. 
Using 
this 
access, 
the 
threat 
actors 
can 
exfiltrate 
data 
and 
carry 
out 
further 
activities 
on 
the 
system, 
including 
interacting 
directly 
with 
the 
system’s 
command 
shell 
and 
downloading 
and 
executing 
additional 
tools 
for 
further 
functionality. 



The 
infrastructure 
associated 
with 
the 
Emissary 
C2 
servers 
used 
in 
this 
attack 
includes 
ustar5.PassAs[.]us, 
203.124.14.229 
and 
dnt5b.myfw[.]us. 
The 
infrastructure 
is 
rather 
isolated 
as 
the 
only 
overlap 
in 
domains 
includes 
appletree.onthenetas[.]com. 
The 
overlap, 
as 
seen 
in 
Figure 
9 
involves 
two 
IP 
addresses 
that 
during 
the 
same 
time 
frame 
resolved 
both 
the 
appletree.onthenetas[.]com 
domain 
and 
the 
Emissary 
C2 
domain 
of 
ustar5.PassAs[.]us. 
The 
other 
C2 
domain 
used 
by 
this 
Emissary 
payload, 
specifically 
dnt5b.myfw[.]us 
currently 
resolves 
to 
the 
127.0.0.1. 
This 
provides 
another 
glimpse 
into 
TTPs 
for 
these 
threat 
actors, 
as 
it 
suggests 
that 
the 
threat 
actors 
set 
the 
secondary 
C2 
domains 
to 
resolve 
to 
the 
localhost 
IP 
address 
to 
avoid 
network 
detection 
and 
change 
this 
to 
a 
routable 
IP 
address 
when 
they 
need 
the 
C2 
server 
operational.Additionally, 
while 
this 
infrastructure 
does 
not 
overlap 
with 
that 
used 
in 
Operation 
Lotus 
Blossom, 
that 
also 
fits 
with 
the 
TTPs. 
In 
each 
case, 
the 
threat 
actors 
used 
separate 
infrastructure 
for 
different 
targets, 
another 
way 
to 
help 
avoid 
detection.

APT 
threat 
actors, 
most 
likely 
nation 
state-sponsored, 
targeted 
a 
diplomat 
in 
the 
French 
Ministry 
of 
ForeignAffairs 
with 
a 
seemingly 
legitimate 
invitation 
to 
a 
technology 
conference 
in 
Taiwan. 
It 
is 
entirely 
possible 
the 
diplomat 
was 
truly 
invited 
to 
the 
conference, 
or 
at 
least 
would 
not 
have 
been 
surprised 
by 
the 
invitation, 
adding 
to 
the 
likelihood 
the 
attachment 
would 
have 
been 
opened. 
The 
actors 
were 
attempting 
to 
exploit 
CVE-2014-6332 
to 
install 
a 
new 
version 
of 
the 
Emissary 
Trojan, 
specifically 
version 
5.3. 


The 
Emissary 
Trojan 
is 
related 
to 
the 
Elise 
malware 
used 
inOperation 
Lotus 
Blossom, 
which 
was 
an 
attack 
campaign 
on 
targets 
in 
SoutheastAsia, 
in 
many 
cases 
also 
with 
official 
looking 
decoy 
documents 
that 
do 
not 
appear 
to 
have 
been 
available 
online. 
Additionally, 
the 
targeting 
of 
a 
French 
diplomat 
based 
in 
Taipei, 
Taiwan 
aligns 
with 
previous 
targeting 
by 
these 
actors, 
as 
does 
the 
separate 
infrastructure. 
Based 
on 
the 
targeting 
and 
lures, 
Unit 
42 
assesses 
that 
the 
threat 
actors’ 
collection 
requirements 
not 
only 
include 
militaries 
and 
government 
agencies 
in 
SoutheastAsia, 
but 
also 
nations 
involved 
in 
diplomatic 
and 
trade 
agreements 
with 
them.
