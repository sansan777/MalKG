Operation 
Pawn 
Storm 
is 
a 
campaign 
known 
to 
target 
military, 
embassy, 
and 
defense 
contractor 
personnel 
from 
the 
United 
States 
and 
its 
allies. 
The 
attackers 
behind 
Operation 
Pawn 
Storm 
have 
been 
active 
since 
at 
least 
2007 
and 
they 
continue 
to 
launch 
new 
campaigns. 


Over 
the 
past 
year 
or 
so, 
we 
have 
seen 
numerous 
techniques 
and 
tactics 
employed 
by 
this 
campaign, 
such 
as 
the 
use 
of 
an 
iOS 
espionage 
app, 
and 
the 
inclusion 
of 
new 
targets 
like 
the 
White 
House. 
Through 
our 
on-going 
investigation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
this 
targeted 
attack 
campaign, 
we 
found 
suspicious 
URLs 
that 
hosted 
a 
newly 
discovered 
zero-day 
exploit 
in 
Java 
now 
identified 
by 
Oracle 
as 
CVE-2015-2590. 
This 
is 
the 
first 
time 
in 
nearly 
two 
years 
that 
a 
new 
Java 
zero-day 
vulnerability 
was 
reported. 


The 
report 
below 
outlines 
the 
traffic 
observed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
attack, 
not 
the 
exploit 
itself. 
Our 
blog 
entry 
on 
how 
the 
exploit 
itself 
works 
can 
be 
found 
here. 
This 
blog 
entry 
is 
intended 
to 
help 
readers 
identify 
traffic 
in 
their 
network 
that 
would 
indicate 
if 
such 
an 
exposure 
had 
occurred. 
We 
strongly 
recommend 
that 
all 
readers 
roll 
out 
the 
Oracle 
patch 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 


Infection 
sequence 


Trend 
Micro 
has 
observed 
that 
an 
entity 
belonging 
to 
the 
target 
profile 
received 
an 
email 
that 
contains 
the 
following 
URL: 



hxxp://ausameetings[.]com/url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/ 


It 
is 
worth 
noting 
that 
the 
spearphishing 
domain 
used 
is 
ausameetings[.]com, 
a 
play 
on 
the 
valid 
domain 
“ausameetings.org,” 
which 
is 
a 
site 
forAUSA’s 
(Association 
of 
the 
United 
StatesArmy) 
annual 
exposition, 
commonly 
held 
in 
mid-October. 
The 
domain 
was 
only 
registered 
last 
July 
8, 
which 
implies 
a 
one-time 
use 
for 
a 
specific 
set 
of 
targets. 


When 
assessing 
this 
URL, 
it 
was 
determined 
that 
the 
most 
probable 
infection 
sequence 
is: 



Figure 
1. 
Infection 
chain 


Like 
all 
multi-stage 
infections, 
a 
successful 
execution 
of 
the 
previous 
stage 
is 
required 
before 
moving 
to 
the 
next 
stage 
down. 
In 
Stage 
1, 
the 
sequence 
is 
initiated 
by 
clicking 
on 
the 
URLembedded 
within 
the 
victim’s 
spearphishing 
email. 


Once 
the 
Java 
exploit 
of 
Stage 
1 
is 
successful, 
it 
downloads 
the 
PE 
file 
(Stage 
2). 
Once 
the 
PE 
file 
is 
downloaded 
and 
executed 
it 
drops 
and 
runs 
the 
DLLfile 
(Stage 
3) 
which 
is 
the 
final 
component 
to 
infect 
the 
machine 
with 
SEDNIT. 


The 
information 
that 
we 
have 
on 
each 
of 
these 
steps 
is 
as 
follows. 
Further 
information 
on 
each 
of 
these 
stages 
can

Stage 
1 
– 
the 
Java 
exploit 


The 
first 
stage 
of 
the 
infection 
sequence 
comes 
through 
a 
targeted, 
spearphishing 
attempt 
against 
the 
victim, 
which 
is 
the 
observed 
method 
for 
Operation 
Pawn 
Storm 
attacks. 


The 
initial 
spearphishing 
URLis 
constructed 
similar 
to: 



hxxp://ausameetings[.]com/url?=[a-zA-Z0-9]{7}/2015annualmeeting/ 
The 
web 
pages 
on 
this 
domain 
that 
were 
found 
to 
drop 
the 
Java 
zero-day 
exploit 
include: 


about 
12 
hours 
ago

(19,225 
bytes)

3_544306 
index.htm 
(4,077 
bytes) 
– 
detected 
as 
HTML_JNLPER.HAQ 
The 
network 
traffic 
observed 
for 
the 
infection 
sequence 
of 
this 
stage 
is: 
StayUpdated
1. 
Send 
the 
initial 
POST 
as 
per 
the 
spearphishing 
email 
to 
ausameetings[.]com, 
which 
includes 
the 
Email 
Subscription 


2015annualmeeting 
URI 
path. 



Your 
email 
here 


2. 
Send 
an 
encoded 
POST 
call, 
which, 
when 
decoded, 
is 
the 
variable 
to 
construct 
the 
subsequently 
used 
URI 
path. 
This 
is 
particularly 
interesting 
as 
it 
appears 
that 
each 
URI 
path 
on 
the 
malicious 
server 
is 
customized 
by 
the 
victim’s 
infection, 
rather 
than 
static 
on 
the 
web 
server. 
3. 
The 
victim 
machine 
then 
does 
a 
variety 
of 
GET 
calls 
to 
pull 
down 
JPG, 
JNLP, 
and 
Java 
class 
files. 
4. 
If 
the 
Java 
class 
files 
cannot 
be 
found 
on 
the 
primarily 
domain 
(ausameetings[.]com), 
it 
appears 
to 
instead 
attempt 
to 
get 
these 
files 
from 
a 
hardcoded 
IP 
(87[.]236[.]215[.]132). 
5. 
Once 
the 
class 
files 
are 
downloaded, 
the 
victim 
machine 
then 
does 
a 
GET 
call 
to 
fetch 
the 
file 
cormac.mcr. 
This 
file 
is 
the 
PE 
file 
for 
Stage 
2. 
For 
completeness, 
the 
specific 
traffic 
calls 
observed 
relating 
to 
Stage 
1

Trend 
Micro 
detects 
this 
file 
as 
TROJ_DROPPR.CXC. 
The 
primary 
purpose 
of 
this

is 
to 
drop

load 
the

It 
is 
downloaded

It

It 
bears 
stressing 
that 
we 
do 
not 
encourage 
using 
the

presented 
above 
as 
IOCs 
for 
your 
own 
analysis. 
The 
network

generated 
by 
this

was 
a 
challenge 
to 
assess

it 
appears 
to 
have 
polymorphic

in 
the

of

After 
assessing 
the

multiple

each

appeared 
to 
be 
different, 
no

what

was 
performed 
(e.g., 
same 
machine, 
different 
machines, 
different 
geographic 
IP 
space 
globally, 
etc.). 


After 
detailed 
network 
forensics 
of 
the 
traffic, 
it 
was 
determined 
that 
no 
single 
stable 
URLpath 
or 
URI 
query 
component 
(URI 
path 
component, 
file 
name, 
or 
URI 
query 
parameter) 
showed 
a 
consistent 
pattern 
(either 
same 
entry 
nor 
regex 
definable 
pattern), 
and 
further 
reverse 
engineering 
was 
required 
to 
determine 
the 
methods 
used 
to 
achieve 
this. 


As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
additional 
analysis, 
it 
was 
determined 
that 
the 
URI 
path 
is 
a 
random 
generated 
string 
with 
the 
following 
pattern: 



^/([a-zA-Z0-9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,3}=<Encoded 
ID> 

Figure

Regex 
expression 


Included 
in 
the 
POST 
request 
is 
a 
data 
encoded 
with 
Base64 
and 
XOR 
encryption. 
The 
encoded 
data 
contains 
the 
following 
system 
information 
of 
the 
infected 
machine: 



OS 
Version 
List 
of

Hard 
Disk

Information 
Volume 
Serial 
Number 
TSPY_SEDNIT.C 
connects 
to 
three 
C&C 
servers: 



192[.]111[.]146[.]185 
(direct 
to 
IP 
call) 
www[.]acledit[.]com 



www[.]biocpl[.]org 


After 
sending 
the 
encrypted 
data 
it 
will 
wait 
for 
a 
reply 
which 
is 
encrypted 
by 
the 
same 
algorithm 
above. 


Phase 
2 
of 
the 
attack: 
the 
keystroke 
logger 


Based 
on 
our 
investigation 
of 
Operation 
Pawn 
Storm, 
we 
know 
that 
the 
infection 
happens 
in 
two 
stages: 



In 
phase 
1, 
opening 
the 
email 
attachment 
or 
clicking 
on 
the 
malicious 
URI 
initiates 
the 
download 
of 
the 
first 
level 
dropper, 
which 
installs 
the 
downloader 
component 
(.DLLfile). 
In 
phase 
2, 
the 
downloader 
component 
communicates 
with 
a 
C&C 
server 
and 
downloads 
other 
components, 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
chain 
a 
keylogger 
is 
installer. 
The 
keylogger 
sends 
data 
back 
to 
the 
C&C 
server. 
As 
of 
writing, 
we 
have 
not 
succeeded 
in 
triggering 
Phase 
2, 
which 
will 
download 
a 
fourth 
stage 
malware 
from 
the 
C&C 
servers. 
This 
fourth 
stage 
malware 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
an 
encrypted 
executable 
file. 


Victims 
of 
the 
Attack 


Anumber 
of 
victims 
were 
identified 
during 
the 
course 
of 
our 
investigation. 
The 
targets 
are 
in 
the 
United 
States 
or 
Canada, 
and 
those 
we 
were 
able 
to 
identify 
via 
IP 
are 
big 
defense 
contractors, 
as 
typical 
for 
Operation 
PawnStorm.
