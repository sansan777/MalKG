Update 9/18: CCleaner 
Cloud 
version 1.07.3191 
is 
also 
reported 
to 
be 
affected 
Update 
9/19: 
This 
issue 
was 
discovered 
and 
reported 
by 
both 
Morphisec 
and 
Cisco 
in separate 
in-eld cases and reported separately to Avast.
-Update 
9/19: 
There 
has 
been some 
confusion on how 
the 
DGA 
domains 
resolve. 

The 
fallback 
command 
and 
control 
scheme 
in use 
by 
the 
CCBkdr 
involves: 
1. 
Generating 
a 
Monthly 
Domain name 
(all 
of 
which 
are 
controlled 
by 
Talos 
for 
2017) 
2. 
Request 
the 
A 
records 
for 
the 
domain. 
3. 
16 
bits 
of 
the 
true 
destination IP 
are 
encoded 
in the 
rst 
A 
record, 
16 
bits 
are 
encoded 
in the 
second 
A 
record 
4. 
The 
true 
destination IP 
is 
then computed 
and 
connected 
to. 
To 
control 
the 
connections 
Talos 
has 
to 
create 
two 
IPs 
such 
that 
they 
can be 
fed 
into 
the 
application to 
resolve 
to 
the 
sinkhole 
IP. 
32 
bits 
of 
random 
data 
were 
generated. 
16 
bits 
of 
that 
were 
combined 
with 
16 
bits 
of 
the 
destination address 
to 
create 
the 
rst 
A 
record. 
The 
remaining 
16 
random 
bits 
were 
combined 
with 
the 
remaining 
bits 
of 
the 
destination address 
to 
create 
the 
second 
A 
record. 
The 
resulting 
two 
A 
record 
IP 
addresses 
were 
then assigned 
to 
the 
DNS 
conguration. 
There 
was 
no 
analysis 
performed 
on the 
selected 
addresses 
beyond 
that 
they 
could 
be 
combined 
to 
create 
the 
destination.

INTRODUCTION 
Supply chain attacks are a very effective way to distribute malicious software into target organizations. This is because with supply chain attacks, the attackers are relying on the trust relationship between a manufacturer or supplier and a customer. This trust relationship is then abused to attack organizations and individuals and may be performed for a number of different reasons. The Nyetya worm 
that 
was 
released 
into 
the 
wild 
earlier 
in 2017 
showed 
just 
how 
potent 
these types of attacks can be. Frequently, as with Nyetya, the initial infection vector can remain elusive for quite some time. Luckily with tools like AMP the additional visibility can usually help direct attention to the initial vector. 
Talos 
recently 
observed 
a 
case 
where 
the 
download 
servers 
used 
by 
software 
vendor 
to 
distribute 
a 
legitimate 
software 
package 
were 
leveraged 
to 
deliver 
malware 
to 
unsuspecting 
victims. 
For a period of time, the legitimate signed version of CCleaner 5.33 being distributed by Avast 
also 
contained 
a 
multi-stage 
malware 
payload 
that 
rode 
on top 
of 
the 
installation of 
CCleaner. 
CCleaner 
boasted 
over 
2 
billion total 
downloads 
by 
November 
of 
2016 
with 
a 
growth 
rate 
of 
5 
million additional 
users 
per 
week. 
Given 
the 
potential 
damage 
that 
could 
be 
caused 
by 
a 
network 
of 
infected 
computers 
even a 
tiny 
fraction of 
this 
size 
we 
decided 
to 
move 
quickly. 
On September 
13, 
2017 
Cisco 
Talos 
immediately 
notied 
Avast 
of 
our 
ndings 
so 
that 
they 
could 
initiate 
appropriate 
response 
activities. 
The 
following 
sections 
will 
discuss 
the 
specic 
details 
regarding 
this attack. 

TECHNICAL 
DETAILS 

CCleaner 
is 
an application that 
allows 
users 
to 
perform 
routine 
maintenance 
on their 
systems. 
It 
includes 
functionality 
such 
as 
cleaning 
of 
temporary 
les, 
analyzing 
the 
system 
to 
determine-ways 
in which 
performance 
can be 
optimized 
and 
provides 
a 
more 
streamlined 
way 
to 
manage 
installed 
applications. 
Figure 1: Screenshot of CCleaner 5.33 
On September 13, 2017 while conducting customer beta testing of our new exploit detection technology, Cisco Talos identied a specic executable which was triggering our advanced malware protection systems. Upon closer inspection, the executable in question was the installer for CCleaner v5.33, which was being delivered to endpoints by the legitimate CCleaner download servers. Talos began initial analysis to determine what was causing this technology to ag CCleaner. We 
identied 
that 
even though 
the 
downloaded 
installation executable 
was 
signed 
using 
a 
valid 
digital 
signature 
issued 
to 
Piriform, 
CCleaner 
was 
not 
the 
only 
application that 
came 
with 
the 
download. 
During 
the 
installation of 
CCleaner 
5.33, 
the 
32-bit 
CCleaner 
binary 
that 
was 
included 
also 
contained 
a 
malicious 
payload 
that 
featured 
a 
Domain Generation Algorithm 
(DGA) 
as 
well 
as 
hardcoded 
Command 
and 
Control 
(C2) 
functionality. 
We conrmed that this malicious version of CCleaner was being hosted directly on CCleaner's download server as recently as September 
11, 
2017. 

In reviewing 
the 
Version History 
page 
on the 
CCleaner 
download 
site, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
affected 
version (5.33) 
was 
released 
on August 
15, 
2017. 
On September 12, 2017 version 5.34 was released. The 
version containing 
the 
malicious 
payload 
(5.33) 
was 
being 
distributed 
between 
these 
dates. 
This 
version was 
signed 
using 
a 
valid 
certicate 
that 
was 
issued 
to 
Piriform 
Ltd 
by 
Symantec 
and 
is 
valid 
through 
10/10/2018. 
Piriform 
was 
the 
company 
that 
Avast 
recently 
acquired 
and 
was 
the 
original 
company 
who 
developed 
the 
CCleaner 
software 
application. 

-
Figure 2: Digital Signature of CCleaner 5.33 
A second sample associated with this threat was discovered. This second sample was also signed using a valid digital certicate, however the signing timestamp was approximately 15 
ggg 
gg 
ppp 
y 
minutes 
after 
the 
initial 
sample 
was 
signed. 
The 
presence 
of 
a 
valid 
digital 
signature 
on the 
malicious 
CCleaner 
binary 
may 
be 
indicative 
of 
a 
larger 
issue 
that 
resulted 
in portions 
of 
the 
development 
or 
signing 
process 
being 
compromised. 
Ideally 
this 
certicate 
should 
be 
revoked 
and 
untrusted 
moving 
forward. 
When generating 
a 
new 
cert 
care 
must 
be 
taken to 
ensure 
attackers 
have 
no 
foothold 
within the 
environment 
with 
which 
to 
compromise 
the 
new 
certicate. 
Only 
the 
incident 
response 
process 
can provide 
details 
regarding 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
issue 
and 
how 
to 
best 
address 
it. 
Interestingly 
the 
following 
compilation artifact 
was 
found 
within the 
CCleaner 
binary 
that 
Talos 
analyzed: 
S:\workspace\ccleaner\branches\v5.33\bin\CCleaner\Release\CCleaner.pdb 

Given the 
presence 
of 
this 
compilation artifact 
as 
well 
as 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
binary 
was 
digitally 
-
signed 
using 
a 
valid 
certicate 
issued 
to 
the 
software 
developer, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
an external 
attacker 
compromised 
a 
portion of 
their 
development 
or 
build 
environment 
and 
leveraged 
that 
access 
to 
insert 
malware 
into 
the 
CCleaner 
build 
that 
was 
released 
and 
hosted 
by 
the 
organization. 
It 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
an insider 
with 
access 
to 
either 
the 
development 
or 
build 
environments 
within the 
organization intentionally 
included 
the 
malicious 
code 
or 
could 
have 
had 
an account 
(or 
similar) 
compromised 
which 
allowed 
an attacker 
to 
include 
the 
code. 

It 
is 
also 
important 
to 
note 
that 
while 
previous 
versions 
of 
the 
CCleaner 
installer 
are 
currently 
still 
available 
on the 
download 
server, 
the 
version containing 
the 
malicious 
payloads 
has 
been 
removed and is no longer available. 

MALWARE INSTALLATION 
AND 
OPERATION 

Within the 
32-bit 
CCleaner 
v5.33 
binary 
included 
with 
the 
legitimate 
CCleaner 
v5.33 
installer, 
'__scrt_get_dyn_tls_init_callback' was 
modied 
to 
call 
to 
the 
code 
at 
CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C). This 
was 
done 
to 
redirect 
code 
execution ow 
within the 
CCleaner 
binary 
to 
the 
malicious 
code 
prior 
to 
continuing 
with 
the 
normal 
CCleaner 
operations. 
The 
code 
that 
is 
called 
is 
responsible 
for 
decrypting 
data 
which 
contains 
the 
two 
stages 
of 
the 
malicious 
payload, 
a 
PIC 
(Position Independent 
Code) 
PE 
loader 
as 
well 
as 
a 
DLL 
le 
that 
effectively functions as the malware payload. The malware author had tried to reduce the detection of the malicious DLL by ensuring the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER was zeroed out, suggesting this attacker was trying to remain under the radar to normal detection techniques. 
The binary then creates an executable heap using HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE,0,0). Space is then allocated to this new heap which is where the contents of the decrypted data containing the malware is copied. As the data is copied to the heap, the source data is erased. The PE loader is then called and begins its operation. Once the infection process has been initiated, the binary erases the memory regions that previously contained the PE loader and the DLL le, frees the previously allocated memory, destroys the heap and continues on with normal CCleaner operations. 
The PE loader utilizes position independent coding practices in order to locate the DLL le within It th th DLL it tbl ll th DLLE t Pitt b i 
memory. It 
then maps 
the 
DLL 
into 
executable 
memory, 
calls 
the 
DLLEntryPoint 
to 
begin 
execution of 
the 
DLL 
being 
loaded 
and 
the 
CCleaner 
binary 
continues 
as 
normal. 
Once 
this 
occurs 
the 
malware 
begins 
its 
full execution, 
following 
the 
process 
outlined 
in the 
following 
sections. 
CBkrdr.dll 

The 
DLL 
le 
(CBkdr.dll) 
was 
modied 
in 
an attempt 
to 
evade 
detection and 
had 
the 
IMAGE_DOS_HEADER zeroed out. The 
DLLEntryPoint 
creates 
an execution thread 
so 
that 
control 
can be 
returned 
to 
the 
loader. 
This thread is responsible for calling CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall. 
It 
also 
sets 
up 
a 
Return Oriented 
Programming 
(ROP) 
chain that 
is 
used 
to 
deallocate 
the 
memory 
associated 
with 
the 
DLL 
and 
exit 
the 
thread. 

CCBkrdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall 
This 
function is 
responsible 
for 
much 
of 
the 
malicious 
operations 
that 
Talos 
observed 
while-analyzing 
this 
malware. 
First, 
it 
records 
the 
current 
system 
time 
on the 
infected 
system. 
It 
then 
delays 
for 
601 
seconds 
before 
continuing 
operations, 
likely 
an attempt 
to 
evade 
automated 
analysis 
systems 
that 
are 
congured 
to 
execute 
samples 
for 
a 
predened 
period 
of 
time 
or 
determine 
whether 
the 
malware 
is 
being 
executed 
in a 
debugger. 
In order 
to 
implement 
this 
delay 
functionality, 
the 
malware 
calls 
a 
function which 
attempts 
to 
ping 
224.0.0.0 
using 
a 
delay_in_seconds 
timeout 
set 
to 
601 
seconds. 
It 
then checks 
to 
determine 
the 
current 
system 
time 
to 
see 
if 
600 
seconds 
has 
elapsed. 
If 
that 
condition is 
not 
met, 
the 
malware 
terminates 
execution while 
the 
CCleaner 
binary 
continues 
normal 
operations. 
In situations 
where 
the 
malware 
is 
unable 
to 
execute 
IcmpCreateFile, 
it 
then falls 
back 
to 
using 
Sleep() 
to 
implement 
the 
same 
delay 
functionality. 
The 
malware 
also 
compares 
the 
current 
system 
time 
to 
the 
value 
stored 
in the 
following 
registry 
location: 
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo:TCID 

If 
the 
value 
stored 
in TCID 
is 
in the 
future, 
the 
malware 
will 
also 
terminate 
execution. 

Figure 3: Delay Routine 
The malware then checks to determine the privileges assigned to the user running on the system. If the current user running the malicious process is not an administrator the malware will terminate execution. 
Figure 4: Privilege Check 
If 
the 
user 
executing 
the 
malware 
does 
have 
administrative 
privileges 
on the 
infected 
system, 
SeDebugPrivilege 
is 
enabled 
for 
the 
process. 
The 
malware 
then reads 
the 
value 
of 
'InstallID' 
which 
is 
stored 
in the 
following 
registry 
location: 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo:MUID 

-
If 
this 
value 
does 
not 
exist, 
the 
malware 
creates 
it 
using 
'((rand()*rand() 
^ 
GetTickCount())'. 

Once 
the 
aforementioned 
activities 
have 
been performed, 
the 
malware 
then begins 
proling 
the 
system 
and 
gathering 
system 
information which 
is 
later 
transmitted 
to 
the 
C2 
server. 
System 
information is 
stored 
in the 
following 
data 
structure: 

Figure 
5: 
CCBkdr_System_Information 
Data 
Structure 
Once 
the 
system 
information has 
been 
collected, 
it 
is 
encrypted 
and 
then encoded 
using 
modied 
Base64. 
The 
malware 
then establishes 
a 
Command 
and 
Control 
(C2) 
channel 
as 
described 
in the 
following 
section. 
COMMAND 
AND 
CONTROL 
(C2) 
While 
analyzing 
this 
malware, 
Talos 
identied 
what 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
software 
bug 
present 
in the 
malicious 
code 
related 
to 
the 
C2 
function. 
The 
sample 
that 
Talos 
analyzed 
reads 
a 
DGA 
computed 
IP 
address 
located 
in the 
following 
registry 
location, 
but 
currently 
does 
nothing 
with 
it: 
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo:NID 
It 
is 
unknown what 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
IP 
address 
is 
at 
this 
time, 
as 
the 
malware 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
make 
use 
of 
it 
during 
subsequent 
operations. 
In any 
event, 
once 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
system 
information has 
been collected 
and 
prepared 
for 
transmission to 
the 
C2 
server, 
the 
malware 
will 
then attempt 
to 
transmit 
it 
using 
an HTTPS 
POST 
request 
to 
216[.]126[.]225[.]148. 
The 
HTTPS 
communications 
leverage 
a 
hardcoded 
HTTP 
Host 
header 
that 
is 
set 
to 
speccy[.]piriform[.]com, 
a 
legitimate 
platform 
which 
is 
also 
created 
by 
Piriform 
for 
hardware 
monitoring. 
This 
could 
make 
dynamic 
analysis 
more 
dicult 
as 
the 
domain would 
appear 
to 
be 
legitimate 
and 
perhaps 
even expected 
depending 
on the 
victim 
infrastructure. 
The 
requests 
also 
leverage 
HTTPS 
but 
ignore 
all 
security 
errors 
as 
the 
server 
currently 
returns 
a 
self-signed 
SSL 
certicate 
that 
was 
issued 
to 
the 
subdomain dened 
in the 
Host 
header 
eld. 
In cases 
where 
no 
response 
is 
received 
from 
the 
C2 
server, 
the 
malware 
then fails 
back 
to 
a 
Domain Generation 
Algorithm 
(DGA) 
as 
described 
in the 
section 'Domain Generation Algorithm' 
of 
this 
post. 
Once 
a 
C2 
server 
has 
been identied 
for 
use 
by 
the 
malware, 
it 
then sends 
the 
encoded 
data 
containing 
system 
prole 
information and 
stores 
the 
C2 
IP 
address 
in the 
following 
registry 
location: 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo:NID 
-
The 
malware 
then stores 
the 
value 
of 
the 
current 
system 
time 
plus 
two 
days 
into 
the 
following 
registry 
location: 

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo:TCID 
Data 
received 
from 
the 
C2 
server 
is 
then validated 
to 
conrm 
that 
the 
received 
data 
is 
in the 
correct 
format 
for 
a 
CCBkdr_ShellCode_Payload 
structure. 
An example 
is 
shown below: 
Figure 
6: 
CCBkdr_ShellCode_Payload 
Data 
Structure 

The malware then conrms that the value of EncryptedInstallID matches the value that was previously transmitted to the C2 server. It then allocates memory for the nal shellcode payload. The payload is then decoded using modied Base64 and stored into the newly allocated memory region. It is then decrypted and called with the addresses of LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress as parameters. Once the payload has been executed, the memory is deallocated and the following registry value is set to the current system time plus seven days: 
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo:TCID 
The received buffer is then zeroed out and deallocated. The CCBkdr_ShellCode_Payload structure is also deallocated and the malware then continues with normal CCleaner operations. A diagram describing the high level operation of this malware is below: 
-Figure

Malware 
Operation 
Process 
Flow 

Domain 
Generation 
Algorithm 

In situations 
where 
the 
primary 
C2 
server 
does 
not 
return a 
response 
to 
the 
HTTP 
POST 
request 
described in the previous section, the malware fails back to using a DGA algorithm. The algorithm used by this malware is time-based and can be calculated using the values of year and month. A list of DGA domains is below: 
Figure 
8: 
12 Month 
DGA 
Genearation 
The 
malware 
will 
initiate 
DNS 
lookups 
for 
each 
domain generated 
by 
the 
DGA 
algorithm. 
If 
the 
DNS 
lookup 
does 
not 
result 
in the 
return of 
an IP 
address, 
this 
process 
will 
continue. 
The 
malware 
will 
perform 
a 
DNS 
query 
of 
the 
active 
DGA 
domain and 
expects 
that 
two 
IP 
addresses 
will 
be 
returned 
from 
the 
name 
server 
managing 
the 
DGA 
domain's 
namespace. 
The 
malware 
will 
then 
compute 
a 
secondary 
C2 
server 
by 
performing 
a 
series 
of 
bit 
operations 
on the 
returned 
IP 
address 
values 
and 
combine 
them 
to 
determine 
the 
actual 
fallback 
C2 
server 
address 
to 
use 
for 
subsequent 
C2

showing 
this 
process 
is

Cisco 
Talos 
observed 
during 
analysis 
that 
the 
DGA 
domains 
had 
not 
been registered, 
so 
we 
registered 
and 
sinkholed 
them 
to 
prevent 
attackers 
from 
being 
able 
to 
use 
them 
for 
malicious 
purposes. 
POTENTIAL IMPACT 
The impact of this attack could be severe given the extremely high number of systems possibly affected. CCleaner claims to have over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of November 2016 and is reportedly adding new users at a rate of 5 million a week. 
Figure 
10: 
CCleaner 
Consumer 
Demographics 

If 
even a 
small 
fraction of 
those 
systems 
were 
compromised 
an attacker 
could 
use 
them 
for 
any 
number 
of 
malicious 
purposes. 
Affected 
systems 
need 
to 
be 
restored 
to 
a 
state 
before 
August 
15, 
2017 
or 
reinstalled. 
Users 
should 
also 
update 
to 
the 
latest 
available 
version of 
CCleaner 
to 
avoid 
infection. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
this 
writing 
that 
is 
version 5.34. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
according 
to 
the 
CCleaner 
download 
page, 
the 
free 
version of 
CCleaner 
does 
not 
provide 
automated 
updates, 
so 
this 
might 
be 
a 
manual 
process 
for 
affected 
users. 
In analyzing 
DNS-based 
telemetry 
data 
related 
to 
this 
attack, 
Talos 
identied 
a 
signicant 
number 
of 
systems 
making 
DNS 
requests 
attempting 
to 
resolve 
the 
domains 
associated 
with 
the 
aforementioned 
DGA 
domains. 
As 
these 
domains 
have 
never 
been registered, 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
-conclude 
that 
the 
only 
conditions 
in which 
systems 
would 
be 
attempting 
to 
resolve 
the 
IP 
addresses 
associated 
with 
them 
is 
if 
they 
had 
been impacted 
by 
this 
malware. 
While 
most 
of 
the 
domains 
associated 
with 
this 
DGA 
have 
little 
to 
no 
request 
trac 
associated 
with 
them, 
the 
domains 
related 
to 
the 
months 
of 
August 
and 
September 
(which 
correlates 
with 
when this 
threat 
was 
active 
in the 
wild) 
show 
signicantly 
more 
activity. 
Looking 
at 
the 
DNS 
related 
activity 
observed 
by 
Cisco 
Umbrella 
for 
the 
month 
of 
July 
2017 
(prior 
to 
CCleaner 
5.33 
being 
released) 
we 
observed 
very 
little 
in the 
way 
of 
DNS 
requests 
to 
resolve 
the 
IP 
address 
for 
DGA 
domain associated 
with 
this 
malware: 

Figure 
11: 
DNS 
Activity 
for 
July 
2017 DGA 
Domain 
As mentioned earlier in this post, the version of CCleaner that included this malware was released on August 15, 2017. The following graph shows a signicant increase in the amount of DNS activity associated with the DGA domain used in August 2017: 
Figure 12: DNS Activity for August 2017 DGA Domain 
Likewise, 
the 
DGA 
domain associated 
with 
September 
2017 
reects 
the 
following 
activity 
with 
regards 
to 
attempts 
to 
resolve 
the 
IP 
associated 
with 
it: 

Figure 
13: 
DNS 
Activity 
for 
September

-
Note 
that 
in on September 
1, 
2017 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
DNS 
activity 
shifted 
from 
the 
DGA 
domain 
previously 
used 
in August, 
to 
the 
one 
used 
in September, 
which 
matches 
the 
time-based 
DGA 
algorithm 
described 
in the 
"Domain Generation Algorithm" 
section of 
this 
blog 
post. 
After 
reaching 
out 
to 
Avast 
we 
noted 
that 
the 
server 
was 
taken down and 
became 
unavailable 
to 
already infected systems. As 
a 
result, 
we 
saw 
a 
signicant 
increase 
in the 
amount 
of 
requests 
that 
were 
being 
directed 
at 
the 
failback 
DGA 
domains 
used 
by 
the 
malware.

It is also worth noting that at the time of this post, antivirus detection for this threat remains very low (The detections are at 1/64 at the time of this writing).

As 
part 
of 
our 
response 
to 
this 
threat, 
Cisco 
Talos 
has 
released 
comprehensive 
coverage 
to 
protect customers. Details 
related 
to 
this 
coverage 
can be 
found 
in the 
"Coverage" 
section of 
this 
post. 

CONCLUSION 

This 
is 
a 
prime 
example 
of 
the 
extent 
that 
attackers 
are 
willing 
to 
go 
through 
in their 
attempt 
to 
distribute 
malware 
to 
organizations 
and 
individuals 
around 
the 
world. 
By 
exploiting 
the 
trust 
relationship 
between software 
vendors 
and 
the 
users 
of 
their 
software, 
attackers 
can benet 
from 
users' 
inherent 
trust 
in the 
les 
and 
web 
servers 
used 
to 
distribute 
updates. 
In many 
organizations 
data 
received 
from 
commonly 
software 
vendors 
rarely 
receives 
the 
same 
level 
of 
scrutiny 
as 
that 
which 
is 
applied 
to 
what 
is 
perceived 
as 
untrusted 
sources. 
Attackers 
have 
shown that 
they 
are 
willing 
to 
leverage 
this 
trust 
to 
distribute 
malware 
while 
remaining 
undetected. 
Cisco 
Talos 
continues 
to 
monitor 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
threat 
landscape 
to 
quickly-identify 
new 
and 
innovative 
techniques 
used 
by 
attackers 
to 
target 
organizations 
and 
individuals 
around the world.

I have the 5.34 version of CCleaner installed on my computer and i had probably the 5.33 version before. My computer is still vulnerable or not ? What can I do to ensure my computer is clean ?

This isn't a vulnerability. The 
5.33 
installer 
had 
malware 
included 
with 
it 
during 
the 
time 
window 
indicated 
in the 
blog. 
If 
you upgraded 
from 
5.33 
which 
was 
installed 
in the 
above 
window 
you should 
recover 
from 
a 
backup 
prior 
to 
that 
version.

That really depends on how the antivirus program works. Generally speaking I would recommend reinstalling but if you don't have backups you could try 
g  y  p  y  y

Uninstalling the tool will not remove the malware. To remove the malware you should restore from a previous backup that is known to be clean or try a virus removal tool.

I manage the Antivirus systems for my Employer's business here at Triella in Canada and I have evidence from Webroot that this started much earlier than August. We have a client record of a blocked CCLeaner.exe detection on June 25th agged as W32.Hacktool.Rpdpatch We were lucky that I did not whitelist the threat as safe becasue at the time Webroot had a problem with mis-categorizing legitimate software as malware. This threat was found on a server and since we regularly used CCleaner on desktops but not servers, I was suspicious of it and contacted Webroot support about it as well. I am going to be posting an article on our website about this shortly.

Is the process of installing ccleaner 
alone 
enough 
to 
execute 
the 
malicious 
payload 
or 
would 
the 
32bit

of 
ccleaner.exe
