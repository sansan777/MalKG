Unit

recently 
observed 
a 
9002 
Trojan 
delivered 
using 
a 
combination 
of 
shortened 
links 
and 
a 
shared 
file 
hosted 
on 
Google 
Drive. 
The 
delivery 
method 
also 
uses 
an 
actor-controlled 
server 
hosting 
a 
custom 
redirection 
script 
to 
track 
successful 
clicks 
by 
targeted 
email 
addresses. 
The 
infrastructure 
associated 
with 
this 
9002 
Trojan 
sample 
was 
also 
found 
to 
have 
previous 
ties 
to 
attacks 
on 
Myanmar 
and 
otherAsian 
countries 
that 
used 
Poison 
Ivy 
as 
the 
payload, 
including 
a 
recent, 
and 
possibly 
ongoing 
campaign 
against 
Taiwan. 


While 
we 
do 
not 
have 
specific 
telemetry 
on 
the 
attack 
at 
this 
time, 
we 
believe 
the 
attack 
relies 
on 
a 
shortened 
link 
(in 
this 
case 
using 
the 
URL 
shortening 
service 
TinyURL) 
to 
deliver 
the 
9002 
payload. 
The 
shortened 
URLis 
as 
follows: 


hxxp://tinyurl[.]com/zmu4dry 


Figure

Response 
to

request

delivery 
URL 


The 
second 
test 
HTTP 
request 
we 
issued 
used 
the 
base64 
encoded 
data 
for 
the 
string 
“fake@gmail.comhttp://yahoo.com”, 
which 
as 
seen 
in 
Figure 
2 
would 
redirect 
the 
browser 
to 
“http://yahoo.com” 
via 
an 
HTTP 
302 
response. 
This 
suggests 
that 
the 
email 
string 
is 
not 
used 
for 
any 
sort 
of 
authentication 
for 
the 
inbound 
request, 
and 
instead 
is 
possibly 
used 
by 
the 
threat 
actors 
to 
track 
successful 
clicks 
by 
a 
targeted 
email.

We 
issued 
an 
HTTP 
request 
using 
the 
base64 
encoded 
data 
for 
the 
string 
“fake@gmail.comyahoo.com”.

by 
writing 
“403

This

suggests 
that 
the

on 
the

parses 
the

Test 
request 
showing

requires

within 
the 
base64 
decoded 
data 


We 
ran 
subsequent 
test 
requests 
to 
find 
additional 
strings 
that 
the 
script 
would 
check 
for 
within 
the 
base64 
decoded 
data, 
which 
it 
uses 
to 
determine 
the 
location 
it 
should 
redirect 
the 
browser. 
We 
found 
that 
the 
script 
also 
supports 
redirection 
to 
URLs 
that 
begin 
with 
“https”.Also, 
the 
script 
is 
case 
sensitive, 
as 
requests 
for 
URLs 
with 
“HTTP” 
and 
“HTTPS” 
resulted 
in 
the 
same 
403 
Forbidden 
response 
seen 
in 
Figure 
3. 
Lastly, 
we 
determined 
that 
the 
script 
does 
not 
require 
the 
“://” 
characters 
after 
“http” 
and 
“https”. 


In 
the 
delivery 
of 
this 
attack, 
the 
shortened 
link 
that 
the 
redirection 
server 
redirects 
to 
points 
to 
a 
Zip

hosted 
on 
Google

Trojan 


In 
regards 
to 
the 
payload, 
the 
dropper 
creates 
a 
randomly 
named 
folder 
within 
the 
current 
user’s 
folder 
(%USERPROFILE%), 
which 
it 
uses 
to 
store 
the 
following 
files: 



RealNetwork.exe 
(SHA256:

(SHA256:

f76f639f2a7b8f39abf83737c6d3e533be66398c85ec95526e4b13561e15fbae) 


The 
‘RealNetwork.exe’ 
file 
is 
a 
legitimate 
executable 
signed 
to 
‘RealNetworks, 
Inc.’ 
that 
loads 
‘mpaplugins\MPAMedia.dll’ 
to 
call 
a 
function 
named 
‘BuildDeviceDatabase’. 
The 
threat 
actors 
however, 
leverage 
the 
legitimate 
executable 
to 
sideload 
a 
DLLthey 
created 
by 
saving 
the 
‘mpaplugins\MPAMedia.dll’ 
to 
the 
randomly 
named 
folder 
created 
by 
the 
dropper. 


The 
sideloaded 
‘MPAMedia.dll’ 
DLL 
first 
checks 
to 
make 
sure 
the 
system 
time 
is 
greater 
than 
May 
20, 
2016 
as 
a 
likely 
attempt 
for 
sandbox 
evasion. 
It 
will 
then 
load 
the 
‘main.dll’ 
file 
initially 
saved 
to 
the 
randomly 
named 
folder 
created 
by 
the 
dropper. 
The 
overall 
loading 
process 
of 
this 
Trojan 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
Figure 
6. 



Figure

Overview 
of 
DLLsideloading 
process 


The 
‘MPAMedia.dll” 
DLLcalls 
exported 
functions 
named 
“stdInstall” 
and 
“CreateFunc” 
from 
within 
‘main.dll’. 
The 
‘stdInstall’ 
function 
is 
responsible 
for 
creating 
the 
following 
autorun 
registry 
key 
for 
persistence 
purposes: 


Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\RealNetwork 


The 
‘CreateFunc’ 
exported 
function 
returns 
the 
offset 
within 
the 
‘main.dll’ 
file 
to 
shellcode 
that 
contains 
9002 
Trojan’s 
actual 
functional 
code, 
which 
‘MPAMedia.dll’ 
DLLwill 
then 
create 
a 
thread 
to 
execute 
the 
Trojan. 
The 
9002 
Trojan 
creates 
two 
mutexes 
during 
its 
execution: 
F16ME 
and 
widfasdf. 
It 
also 
creates 
the 
following 
registry 
key 
that 
it 
uses 
to 
store 
the 
path 
to 
the 
user’s 
folder 
(%USERPROFILE%): 


HKCU\Software\Microsoft\F6\uid 


The 
Trojan 
uses 
the 
path 
stored 
in 
this 
registry 
key 
to 
locate 
its 
configuration, 
which 
it 
decrypts 
using 
a 
multiple-byte 
XOR 
algorithm 
and 
a 
key 
of 
“1pKFmjw”. 
Figure 
7 
shows 
a 
hexdump 
of 
the 
decrypted 
configuration 
for 
this 
sample 
of 
9002. 



Figure

9002 
Trojan’s 
configuration 


Using 
the 
configuration 
file 
above, 
the 
9002 
Trojan 
communicates 
with 
the 
following 
domain 
that 
acts 
as 
its 
command 
and 
control 
(C2) 
server: 


logitechwkgame[.]com 


The 
Trojan 
sends 
network 
beacons 
to 
its 
C2 
server 
using 
two 
different 
methods. 
The 
first 
method, 
seen 
in 
Figure 
8 
uses 
a 
custom 
protocol 
on 
TCP 
port 
80 
that 
begins 
with 
the 
string 
‘9002’, 
which 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
tool’s 
name. 
If 
the 
C2 
server 
responds, 
the 
Trojan 
will 
send 
system 
specific 
information 
along 
with 
the 
strings 
“jackhex” 
and 
“2016” 
from 
the 
configuration 
file. 
“jackhex” 
has 
also 
been 
seen 
in 
a 
C2 
for 
what 
is 
likely 
related 
Poison 
Ivy 
activity, 
discussed 
briefly 
later 
in 
this 
blog. 



Figure

9002 
protocol 


The 
second 
beacon 
method 
also 
uses 
TCP 
port 
80, 
but 
this 
method 
uses 
HTTP 
requests 
to 
communicate 
with 
its 
C2 
server. 
Figure 
9 
shows 
a 
sample 
HTTP 
request 
issued 
by 
this 
Trojan, 
which 
has 
a 
user-agent 
of 
“lynx” 
and 
POST 
data 
of 
“AA” 
that 
are 
both 
hardcoded 
into 
the 
payload. 



Figure

Network

from 
9002 
using

request 


The 
two 
beacons 
seen 
generated 
by 
this 
payload 
are 
very 
similar 
to 
those 
generated 
by 
the 
‘3102’ 
variant 
of 
9002 
that 
we 
previously 
analyzed. 
The 
capabilities 
within 
this 
9002 
sample 
are 
very 
similar 
to 
the 
3102 
variant 
discussed, 
as 
its 
main 
functionality 
is 
to 
load 
plugins 
provided 
by 
the 
C2 
server 
and 
call 
an 
exported 
function 
named 
“CreatePluginObj”. 


The 
C2 
server 
‘logitechwkgame[.]com’ 
resolves 
to 
the 
IP 
address 
‘222.239.91[.]30’, 
which 
also 



resolved 
to 
‘admin.nslookupdns[.]com’ 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
‘logitechwkgame[.]com’, 
suggesting 
that 
these 
two 
domains 
are 
associated 
with 
the 
same 
threat 
actors. 
‘admin.nslookupdns[.]com’ 
was 
found 
to 
also 
be 
a 
C2 
for 
Poison 
Ivy 
samples 
associated 
with 
attacks 
on 
Myanmar 
and 
otherAsian 
countries 
as 
discussed 
in 
a 
blog 
published 
byArbor 
Networks.An 
additional 
tie 
between 
the 
activity 
is 
the 
Poison 
Ivy 
C2 
‘jackhex.md5c[.]net’, 
as 
“jackhex” 
is 
not 
a 
common 
word 
or 
phrase 
and 
is 
also 
seen 
in 
the 
beacon 
activity 
with 
the 
previously 
discussed 
9002 
sample. 


In 
addition 
to 
those 
noted 
in 
the 
blog 
byArbor 
Networks, 
we 
found 
several 
other 
Poison 
Ivy 
samples 
using 
the 
same 
mutex, 
created 
by 
the 
same 
parent 
processes, 
and 
using 
most 
of 
the 
same 
C2 
infrastructure. 
However, 
the 
samples 
we 
collected 
lack 
campaign 
IDs 
and 
all 
use 
“version2013” 
as 
the 
password 
to 
encrypt 
its 
communications. 
The 
additional 
Poison 
Ivy 
samples 
also 
provided 
us 
three 
new 
C2 
domains: 



outhmail[.]com 



mxdnsv6[.]com 



microsoftserve[.]com 


Also, 
some 
of 
the 
C2 
domains 
associated 
with 
these 
Poison 
Ivy 
samples 
were 
registered 
with 
emails 
that 
were 
used 
to 
register 
the 
following 
possibly 
related 
domains: 



gooledriveservice[.]com 



queryurl[.]com 



appupdatemoremagic[.]com 


While 
we 
do 
not 
have 
complete 
targeting 
information 
associated 
with 
these 
samples, 
several 
of 
the 
decoy 
files 
were 
in 
Chinese 
and 
appear 
to 
be 
part 
of 
a 
recent 
and 
possibly 
ongoing 
campaign 
targeting 
organizations 
in 
Taiwan. 
The 
decoy 
themes 
centered 
primarily 
around 
cross-strait 
relations 
and 
the 
Taiwanese 
MainlandAffairs 
Council 
(MAC), 
which 
is 
a 
cabinet-level 
organization 
tasked 
with 
creating, 
implementing, 
and 
overseeing 
policies 
between 
Taiwan 
and 
the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China 
(PRC). 


The 
use 
of 
Google 
Drive 
to 
host 
malicious 
files 
is 
not 
a 
new 
tactic 
in 
attacks. 
However, 
using 
a 
well-known 
hosting 
platform 
may 
allow 
the 
downloading 
of 
a 
payload 
to 
blend 
into 
other 
legitimate 
traffic 
from 
the 
hosting 
provider. 
The 
actors 
still 
use 
spear 
phishing 
as 
their 
primary 
attack 
method, 
but 
because 
that 
technique 
has 
been 
so 
well 
publicized, 
intended 
victims 
are 
perhaps 
more 
cautious 
about 
opening 
suspicious 
email 
attachments 
or 
links.As 
spear 
phishing 
becomes 
less 
successful, 
threat 
actors 
need 
to 
continue 
to 
adapt 
and 
find 
new 
methods 
to 
successfully 
deliver 
malware. 
The 
use 
of 
a 
URL 
shortening 
service 
and 
a 
redirection 
server 
further 
aids 
the 
chances 
of 
a 
successful 
attack, 
as 
it 
becomes 
more 
challenging 
to 
determine 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
link 
within 
an 
email 
due 
to 
the 
way 
link 
shorteners 
obfuscate 
link 
content. 


The 
files 
used 
in 
these 
attacks 
are 
properly 
classified 
as 
malware 
by 
WildFire.
