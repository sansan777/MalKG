Last 
week, 
an 
unidentified 
malware 
(with 
SHA-256 
171693ab13668c6004a1e08b83c9877a55f150aaa6d8a624c3f8ffc712b22f0b) 
was 
discovered 
and 
circulated 
(https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/743345104333606912) 
on 
Twitter 
by 
researcher 
@JAMES_MHT. 
Many 
researchers 
-including 
us 
-were 
unable 
to 
identify 
the 
malware 
so 
we 
decided 
to 
dig 
a 
bit 
further. 


In 
this 
post, 
we 
will 
share 
our 
findings 
about 
this 
malware: 
its 
targets, 
technical 
analysis, 
the 
related 
attacks 
and 
the 
threat 
actor 
behind 
it. 


Targets 


One 
of 
the 
first 
things 
we 
wanted 
to 
know 
is 
if 
this 
malware 
has 
a 
specific 
target–thanks 
to 
researcher 
@benkow_ 
(https://twitter.com/benkow_) 
some 
open 
directories 
on 
the 
malware 
C&C 
were 
discovered. 
One 
of 
the 
open 
directories 
contained 
logs 
of 
victim 
IPs 
and 
computer 
names:

While 
there 
are 
not 
that 
many 
IP 
victims 
logged 
on 
this 
particular 
C&C, 
a 
look-up 
on 
ipintel.io 
showed 
a 
concentration 
of 
victims 
from 
Germany 
and 
Austria: 



Incidentally, 
a 
quick 
dump 
of 
the 
malware 
code 
reveals 
the 
string 
“my_de” 
and 
“my_botnet” 
where 
the 
“de” 
in 
the 
first 
string 
may 
refer 
to 
Germany’s 
country 
code: 



Due 
to 
this 
and 
the 
results 
of 
our 
analysis 
below, 
we 
tagged 
this 
malware 
DELoader 
(detected 
as 
W32/DELoader.A!tr). 


DELoader 
Analysis 


In 
a 
nutshell, 
DELoader’s 
primary 
purpose 
is 
to 
load 
additional 
malware 
on 
the 
system. 
It 
does 
this 
by 
initially 
creating 
a 
suspended 
explorer.exe 
process:

It 
then 
proceeds 
to 
decrypt 
an 
embedded 
DLL 
from 
its 
body 
and 
inject 
it 
into 
explorer.exe: 



The 
injected 
DLL 
then 
attempts 
to 
download 
a 
file 
from 
the 
link 
hxxp://remembermetoday4.asia/00/b.bin:

Blog 



Upon 
the 
time 
of 
analysis, 
the 
malware 
C&C 
was 
already 
sinkholed. 
Code-wise, 
the 
malware 
expects 
to 
download 
a 
portable 
executable 
(PE) 
file 
as 
it 
validates 
the 
MZ 
header 
of 
the 
downloaded 
file. 
If 
valid, 
this 
PE 
file 
is 
then 
copied 
to 
a 
newly 
allocated 
memory: 



It 
then 
searches 
for 
instance 
of 
a 
running 
explorer.exe 
process 
where 
it 
then 
injects 
the 
downloaded 
file 
using 
CreateRemoteThread 
API:

DELoader’s 
routine 
doesn’t 
tell 
much 
about 
its 
intentions 
since 
its 
payload 
simply 
installs 
an 
additional 
PE 
file. 
This 
PE 
file 
could 
be 
any 
malware, 
or 
simply 
an 
updated 
copy 
of 
itself. 


Either 
way, 
it 
leads 
us 
to 
the 
next 
question 
– 
what 
is 
the 
motive 
behind 
DELoader? 


Related 
Attacks 


The 
registrant 
information 
of 
the 
malware 
C&C, 
resdomactivationa.asia, 
leads 
us 
to 
the 
next 
clue: 



The 
registrant 
details 
list 
someone 
named 
Aleksandr 
Sirofimov 
from 
Russia. 
Of 
course, 
we 
certainly 
don’t 
know 
if 
Aleksandr 
is 
a 
real 
person, 
a 
stolen 
identity, 
an 
alias 
for 
a 
group, 
or 
the 
‘nom 
de 
guerre’ 
of 
an 
individual 
cybercriminal. 
However, 
the 
important 
thing 
is 
that 
these 
same 
registrant 
details 
have 
been 
frequently 
used 
in 
the 
past 
to 
register 
malicious 
domains.

Below 
is 
an 
overview 
of 
some 
of 
the 
related 
attacks 
we 
were 
able 
to 
correlate 
using 
the 
email 
address 
sir777alex@outlook.com: 



From 
the 
above 
graph 
we 
can 
extract 
the 
infection 
chain 
for 
DELoader, 
which 
is 
delivered 
through 
malicious 
JavaScript 
downloaders: 



Since 
the 
JavaScript 
downloaders 
come 
from 
ZIP 
files 
with 
“invoice” 
themes, 
it 
is 
more 
or 
less 
sent 
to 
victims 
as 
an 
attachment 
to 
malicious 
emails.

Furthermore, 
the 
above 
correlation 
enabled 
us 
to 
identify 
that 
the 
actor 
(or 
actors), 
using 
the 
name 
rd 


“Aleksandr,” 
registered 
malicious 
domains 
as 
early 
as 
the 
3 
quarter 
of 
2015, 
while 
DELoader 
first 
surfaced 
by 
at 
least 
February 
of 
2016. 


One 
of 
the 
malicious 
tools 
“Aleksandr” 
used 
is 
a 
Zeus 
variation 
– 
an 
infamous 
banking 
Trojan 
whose 
source 
code 
was 
leaked 
(http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/the-zeus-source-code-leakednow-
what/) 
five 
years 
ago. 
Here 
is 
a 
graph 
of 
some 
of 
the 
related 
Zeus 
variants 
out 
of 
the 
many 
Zeus 
C&C 
domains 
“Aleksandr” 
registered: 



An 
online 
search 
of 
the 
domain 
goodvin77787.in 
leads 
us 
to 
this 
blog 
(https://rebsnippets.blogspot.com.br/2015/11/dhl-themed-zeus-campaign-is-using.html). 
The 
blog 
talks 
about 
a 
DHL-themed 
Zeus 
campaign 
targeting 
German-speaking 
users 
where 
all 
the 
related 
Zeus 
C&Cs 
were 
registered 
using 
“Aleksandr’s” 
details. 


So 
we 
now 
know 
that 
person 
or 
persons 
behind 
“Aleksandr” 
have 
been 
(or 
are 
still) 
involved 
in 
a 
malicious 
campaign 
for 
stealing 
banking 
credentials. 
True 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
DELoader, 
the 
previous 
campaign 
also 
targeted 
German-speaking 
users. 


Are 
German-Speaking 
Users 
"Aleksandr’s" 
Only 
Target? 


Another 
domain 
the 
individual 
or 
group 
known 
as 
“Aleksandr” 
registered 
is 
bestbrowser-2015.biz. 
This 
domain 
was 
used 
as 
a 
C&C 
server 
for 
Android 
Marcher 
variants 
– 
an 
Android 
banking 
Trojan 
sold 
on 
Russian 
underground 
forums:

Interestingly, 
these 
trojans 
were 
configured 
to 
steal 
credentials 
from 
Australian 
banks. 
Below 
is 
a 
code 
snippet 
from 
one 
of 
the 
Android 
Marcher 
samples: 



It 
is 
worth 
noting 
that 
these 
Marcher 
variants 
surfaced 
around 
the 
same 
time 
“Aleksandr” 
was 
running 
Zeus 
rd 
th 


campaigns 
in 
the 
3 
and 
4 
quarter 
of 
2015. 
This 
suggests 
that 
he 
was 
running 
his 
malicious 
regional 
campaigns 
simultaneously. 


Conclusion 


While 
DELoader 
is 
a 
relatively 
new 
malware, 
the 
findings 
in 
this 
research 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
threat 
actor 
behind 
it 
has 
actually 
been 
around 
for 
quite 
some 
time, 
and 
has 
left 
a 
substantial 
amount 
of 
fingerprints 
over 
the 
Internet. 


Historical 
information 
shows 
that 
the 
individual 
or 
group 
using 
the 
name 
“Aleksandr” 
have 
been 
involved 
in 
bank 
information 
theft 
not 
only 
of 
German-speaking 
users, 
but 
have 
also 
targeted 
Australian 
users. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
DELoader 
may 
be 
used 
to 
aid 
in 
similar 
purposes 
in 
the 
future. 


We 
are 
unable 
to 
confirm 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
“Aleksandr’s” 
registrant 
details, 
or 
if 
he 
(or 
they) 
is 
working 
with 
a 
group. 
We 
may, 
however, 
have 
an 
idea 
on 
where 
“Aleksandr” 
is 
located.

Earlier, 
we 
showed 
that 
the 
geolocations 
of 
DELoader 
victims 
were 
concentrated 
in 
Germany 
and 
Austria. 
You 
might 
have 
also 
noticed 
that 
one 
of 
the 
IPs 
deviated 
from 
that 
area 
– 
it 
resolved 
to 
Kiev,Ukraine: 



This 
is 
odd 
since 
German 
is 
not 
a 
common 
language 
in 
Ukraine. 
So 
we 
theorized 
that 
this 
anomalous 
event 
may 
be 
due 
to 
someone 
testing 
the 
DELoader. 


To 
test 
our 
theory, 
we 
looked 
up 
the 
IP 
in 
the 
C&C 
logs 
to 
find 
more 
information. 
Can 
you 
find 
the 
interesting 
string 
in 
the 
IP’s 
computer 
name 
below? 



High 
five 
if 
you 
found 
“ALEXANDR”.
