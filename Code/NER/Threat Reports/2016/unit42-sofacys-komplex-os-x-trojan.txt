researchers 
identified 
a 
new 
OS 
X 
Trojan 
associated 
with 
the 
Sofacy 
group 
that 
we 
are 
now 
tracking 
with 
the 
‘Komplex’ 
tag 
using 
the 
PaloAlto 
NetworksAutoFocus 
threat 
intelligence 
platform. 


The 
Sofacy 
group, 
also 
known 
asAPT28, 
Pawn 
Storm, 
Fancy 
Bear, 
and 
Sednit, 
continues 
to 
add 
to 
the 
variety 
of 
tools 
they 
use 
in 
attacks; 
in 
this 
case, 
targeting 
individuals 
in 
the 
aerospace 
industry 
running 
the 
OS 
X 
operating 
system. 
During 
our 
analysis, 
we 
determined 
that 
Komplex 
was 
used 
in 
a 
previous 
attack 
campaign 
targeting 
individuals 
running 
OS 
X 
that 
exploited 
a 
vulnerability 
in 
the 
MacKeeper 
antivirus 
application 
to 
deliver 
Komplex 
as 
a 
payload. 
Komplex 
shares 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
functionality 
and 
traits 
with 
another 
tool 
used 
by 
Sofacy 
– 
the 
Carberp 
variant 
that 
Sofacy 
had 
used 
in 
previous 
attack 
campaignson 
systems 
running 
Windows. 
In 
addition 
to 
shared 
code 
and 
functionality, 
we 
also 
discovered 
Komplex 
command 
and 
control 
(C2) 
domains 
that 
overlapped 
with 
previously 
identified 
phishing 
campaign 
infrastructures 
associated 
with 
the 
Sofacy 
group. 



Komplex 
is 
a 
Trojan 
that 
the 
Sofacy 
group 
created 
to 
compromise 
individuals 
using 
OS 
X 
devices. 
The 
Trojan 
has 
multiple 
parts, 
first 
leading 
with 
a 
binder 
component 
that 
is 
responsible 


Regardless 
of 
architecture, 
these 
initial 
binders 
all 
save 
a 
second 
embedded 
Mach-O 
file 
to 
‘/tmp/content’. 
This 
file 
is 
the 
Komplex 
dropper 
used 
in 
the 
next 
stage 
of 
installation 
and 
to 
maintain 
persistence.After 
saving 
the 
Komplex 
dropper, 
these 
binders 
would 
then 
save 
a 
legitimate 
decoy 
document 
to 
the 
system 
and 
open 
them 
using 
the 
‘Preview’ 
application 
to 
minimize 
suspicion 
of 
any 
malicious 
activity.

The 
Komplex 
dropper 
component 
is 
saved 
to 
the 
system 
as 
“/tmp/content” 
(SHA256: 
96a19a90caa41406b632a2046f3a39b5579fbf730aca2357f84bf23f2cbc1fd3) 
and 
is 
responsible 
for 
installing 
a 
third 
executable 
to 
the 
system 
and 
setting 
up 
persistence 
for 
the 
third 
executable 
to 
launch 
each 
time 
the 
OS 
X 
operating 
system 
starts. 
This 
dropper 
also 
provided 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
name 
“Komplex”, 
which 
is 
seen 
in 
several 
folder 
paths 
that 
were 
included 
within 
the 
Mach-O 
file, 
such 
as 
“/Users/kazak/Desktop/Project/komplex”. 


The 
Komplex 
dropper 
is 
fairly 
straightforward 
from 
a 
functional 
perspective, 
as 
it 
contains 
all 
of 
its 
functionality 
within 
its 
“_main” 
function. 
The 
“_main” 
function 
(Figure

accesses 
data 
within 
three 
variables 
named 
‘_Payload_1’, 
‘_Payload_2’ 
and 
‘_Payload_3’, 
and 
writes 
them 
to 
three 
files 
on 
the 
system.

The 
ultimate 
purpose 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
components 
is 
to 
install 
and 
execute 
the 
Komplex 
payload. 
The 
dropper 
component 
saves 
the 
payload 
to 
“/Users/Shared/.local/kextd” 
(SHA256: 
227b7fe495ad9951aebf0aae3c317c1ac526cdd255953f111341b0b11be3bbc5) 
and 
ultimately 
executes 
the 
payload. 
The 
payload 
begins 
by 
conducting 
an 
anti-debugging 
check 
to 
see 
if 
it 
is 
being 
debugged 
before 
proceeding 
with 
executing 
its 
main 
functionality, 
which 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
“AmIBeingDebugged” 
function 
in 
Figure 
6. 
The 
“AmIBeingDebugged” 
function 
uses 
the 
“sysctl” 
function 
to 
check 
to 
see 
if 
a 
specific 
“P_TRACED” 
flag 
is 
set, 
which 
signifies 
that 
the 
process 
is 
being 
debugged. 
Aparticularly 
interesting 
part 
of 
this 
function 
is 
that 
it 
is 
very 
similar 
to 
the 
function 
provided 
byApple 
to 
its 
developers 
in 
a 
guide 
created 
in 
2004 
titled 
“Detecting 
the 
Debugger”. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
first 
time 
the 
Sofacy 
group’s 
malware 
authors 
have 
obtained 
techniques 
from 
publicly 
available 
sources, 
as 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Office 
Test

that 
they 
obtained 
from 
ablog 
posted 
in 
2014.

The 
AmIBeingDebugged 
function 
used 
as 
an 
anti-analysis 
technique 


After 
determining 
that 
it 
is 
not 
running 
in 
a 
debugger, 
the 
payload 
performs 
an 
antianalysis/
sandbox 
check 
by 
issuing 
a 
GET 
request 
to 
Google, 
to 
check 
for 
Internet 
connectivity. 
The 
payload 
will 
sleep 
until 
it 
receives 
a 
response 
from 
the 
HTTP 
requests 
to 
Google, 
which 
means 
Komplex 
will 
only 
communicate 
to 
its 
C2 
servers 
in 
Internet 
enabled 
environments. 
Figure

shows 
the

function 
that 
confirms 
whether 
the

is 
able 
to

“http://www.google.com” 
before 
carrying 
out 
its 
functionality.

base64 
encoded 
ciphertext 
created 
from 
the 
string 
‘h8sn3vq6kl’. 
The 
ciphertext 
of 
the 
string 
is 
generated 
via 
a 
custom 
algorithm 
that 
uses 
a 
random 
4-byte 
integer 
as 
a 
key 
that 
is 
modified 
by 
XOR 
with 
the 
static 
value 
0xE150722. 
The 
payload 
also 
encrypts 
the 
data 
sent 
within 
the 
POST 
request 
using 
the 
same 
algorithm 
and 
encodes 
it 
using 
base64.

in 
Figure

is 
comprised 
of 
information 
that 
the 
malware 
collects 
from 
the

The

includes 
data 
such 
as 
the

The 
Sofacy 
C2 
server 
will 
respond 
to 
this 
HTTP 
request 
with 
encrypted 
data 
that 
the 
payload 
will 
decrypt 
using 
the 
same 
custom 
algorithm 
used 
to 
encrypt 
the 
POST 
data. 
The 
Komplex 
payload 
will 
parse 
the 
C2 
response 
for 
the 
following 
strings: 
“[file]” 
and 
“[/file]”, 
“FileName=”, 
“PathToSave=”, 
“Shell=”, 
“Execute”, 
and 
“Delete”. 
The 
“Delete” 
action 
does 
nothing 
more 
than 
delete 
a 
file 
specified 
by 
‘PathToSave’/’FileName’, 
whereas 
the 
“Execute” 
action 
involves 
running 
the 
following 
system 
commands 
before 
executing 
the 
specified 
file: 


12mkdir-p&lt;'PathToSave'&gt;&amp;&gt;/dev/nullchmod755&lt;'PathToSave'&gt;/&lt;'FileName'&gt;&amp;&gt;/dev/null
The 
payload 
will 
treat 
“[file]” 
and 
“[/file]” 
as 
delimiters 
that 
specify 
the 
data 
that 
the 
payload 
should 
write 
to 
a 
specified 
file, 
which 
allows 
the 
threat 
actor 
to 
download 
additional 
files 
to 
the 
system. 
Lastly, 
the 
payload 
can 
execute 
commands 
on 
the 
compromised 
system 
specified 
within 
the 
“Shell” 
field, 
which 
the 
payload 
will 
execute 
and 
then 
send 
results 
back 
to 
the 
C2. 


Code 
Overlaps 


While 
reverse 
engineering 
the 
Komplex 
payload, 
we 
came 
across 
a 
few 
code 
overlaps 
that 
we 
believed 
were 
worth 
exploring. 
First, 
we 
noticed 
striking 
similarities 
between 
the 
Komplex 
payload 
and 
the 
traits 
and 
behavior 
of 
an 
OS 
X 
Trojan 
discussed 
in 
a 
BAE 
Systems 
blog 
titled 
NEW 
MAC 
OS 
MALWARE 
EXPLOITS 
MACKEEPER.According 
to 
this 
blog 
post, 
an 
OS 
X 
Trojan 
was 
delivered 
via 
a 
vulnerability 
in 
the 
MacKeeper 
application. 
The 
nameless 
OS 
X 
Trojan 
uses 
an 
11-byte 
XOR 
algorithm 
to 
decrypt 
an 
embedded 
configuration, 
which 
has 
all 
of 
the 
same 
variable 
names 
and 
values 
as 
the 
Komplex 
sample 
(see 
Table 
1). 
The 
algorithm 
used 
to 
encrypt 
and 
decrypt 
the 
network 
traffic, 
as 
well 
as 
all 
static 
elements 
of 
the 
network 
communications 
(composition 
of 
URL, 
structure 
of 
HTTP 
data, 
command 
parsing 
procedure, 
etc.) 
discussed 
in 
the 
blog 
post 
are 
the 
exact 
same 
as 
seen 
in 
the 
Komplex 
payload. 
These 
overlaps 
suggest 
that 
the 
Trojan 
delivered 
by 
the 
MacKeeper 
vulnerability 
was 
in 
fact 
the 
Komplex 
Trojan. 


The 
second 
code 
overlap 
ties 
the 
Komplex 
Trojan 
to 
Sofacy’s 
Carberp 
variant, 
which 
we 
have 
analyzed 
in 
previous 
research 
efforts. 
Even 
though 
Komplex 
was 
created 
to 
run 
on 
OS 
X 
and 
Sofacy’s 
Carberp 
variant 
was 
developed 
to 
run 
on 
Windows, 
they 
share 
many 
commonalities, 



including: 



Same 
URLgeneration 
logic 
using 
random 
path 
values, 
a 
random 
file 
extension 
and 
encrypted 
token 
Same 
file 
extensions 
used 
in 
C2 
URLthat 
are 
listed 
within 
the 
binaries 
in 
the 
same 
order 
Same 
algorithm 
used 
to 
encrypt 
and 
decrypt 
the 
token 
in 
the 
URLand 
HTTP 
POST 
data 
(Carberp 
key 
is 
modified 
using 
value 
0xAA7D756 
whereas 
Komplex 
uses 
0xE150722) 
Very 
similar 
command 
handling, 
including 
parsing 
specifically 
for 
Execute, 
Delete, 
[file], 
[/file], 
FileName, 
and 
PathToSave. 
Checks

Internet 
connectivity 
by 
connecting 
to 
google.com 
Uses 
an 
11-byte 
XOR 
key 
to 
decrypt 
strings 
within 
the 
configuration 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
common 
traits, 
we 
found 
a 
Sofacy 
Carberp 
variant 
(SHA256: 
638e7ca68643d4b01432f0ecaaa0495b805cc3cccc17a753b0fa511d94a22bdd) 
using 
the 
same 
TOKEN 
value 
of 
‘h8sn3vq6kl’ 
within 
its 
C2 
URL, 
as 
observed 
in 
Komplex 
payloads. 
Based 
on 
these 
observations, 
we 
believe 
that 
the 
author 
of 
Sofacy’s 
Carberp 
variant 
used 
the 
same 
code, 
or 
at 
least 
the 
same 
design, 
to 
create 
the 
Komplex 
Trojan. 
Abenefit 
of 
retaining 
many 
of 
the 
same 
functionalities 
within 
the 
Windows 
and 
OS 
X 
Trojans 
is 
that 
it 
would 
require 
fewer 
alterations 
to 
the 
C2 
server 
application 
to 
handle 
cross-platform 
implants. 


Infrastructure 
Overlap 


While 
Komplex’s 
C2 
domain 
appleupdate[.]org 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
have 
any 
previously 
known 
activity 
associated 
with 
it, 
both 
the 
apple-iclouds[.]net 
and 
itunes-helper[.]net 
domains 
have 
direct 
ties 
to 
Sofacy 
activity. 
The 
apple-iclouds[.]net 
domain 
is 
mentioned 
within 
a 
PwC 
Tactical 
Intelligence 
Bulletin 
that 
discussed 
a 
phishing 
campaign 
conducted 
by 
the 
Sofacy 
group. 
The 
itunes-helper[.]net 
domain 
is 
associated 
with 
separate 
activity 
discussed 
in 
Trend 
Micro’s 
blog 
titled 
Looking 
Into 
a 
Cyber-Attack 
Facilitator 
in 
the 
Netherlandsthat 
included 
research 
on 
hosting 
providers 
used 
by 
Pawn 
Storm 
(Sofacy). 


The 
domain 
appleupdate[.]org 
does 
have 
one 
interesting 
correlation 
point, 
specifically 
involving 
the 
IP 
185.10.58[.]170 
that 
resolved 
this 
domain 
betweenApril 
2015 
throughApril 
2016. 
Researchers 
at 
BAE 
Systems 
provided 
Unit 
42 
the 
Komplex 
payload 
delivered 
through 
the 
exploitation 
of 
MacKeeper 
(Dropper 
SHA256: 
da43d39c749c121e99bba00ce809ca63794df3f704e7ad4077094abde4cf2a73 
and

45a93e4b9ae5bece0d53a3a9a83186b8975953344d4dfb340e9de0015a247c54), 
which 
used 
the 
IP 
address 
185.10.58[.]170 
within 
its 
configuration 
as 
a 
C2 
server. 
This 
infrastructure 
overlap 
further 
strengthens 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
Komplex 
payload 
we 
discovered 
with 
the 
prior 
campaign 
using 
MacKeeper 
for 
delivery. 


The 
Sofacy 
group 
created 
the 
Komplex 
Trojan 
to 
use 
in 
attack 
campaigns 
targeting 
the 
OS 
X 
operating 
system 
– 
a 
move 
that 
showcases 
their 
continued 
evolution 
toward 
multi-platform 
attacks. 
The 
tool 
is 
capable 
of 
downloading 
additional 
files 
to 
the 
system, 
executing 
and 
deleting 
files, 
as 
well 
as 
directly 
interacting 
with 
the 
system 
shell. 
While 
detailed 
targeting 
information 
is 
not 
currently 
available, 
we 
believe 
Komplex 
has 
been 
used 
in 
attacks 
on 
individuals 
related 
to 
the 
aerospace 
industry, 
as 
well 
as 
attacks 
leveraging 
an 
exploit 
in 
MacKeeper 
to 
deliver 
the 
Trojan. 
The 
Komplex 
Trojan 
revealed 
a 
design 
similar 
to 
Sofacy’s 
Carberp 
variant 
Trojan, 
which 
we 
believe 
may 
have 
been 
done 
in 
order 
to 
handle 
compromised 
Windows 
and 
OS 
X 
systems 
using 
the 
same 
C2 
server 
application 
with 
relative 
ease.
