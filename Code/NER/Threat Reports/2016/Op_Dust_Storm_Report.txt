EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Cylance SPEAR has uncovered 
a long-standing persistent 
threat targeting numerous 
major industries spread across 
Japan, South Korea, the United 
States, Europe, and several other 
Southeast Asian countries. 

Power comes in many forms 

Our research indicates Operation Dust Storm has been 
operational since at least early 2010, and has employed 
a number of different operational techniques, including 
spear phishing, waterholes, and zero-day exploits over 
time. Several antivirus companies initially detected 
early backdoor samples under the moniker Misdat, but 
the group has quietly evolved over the years to remain 
undetected and highly effective. 

Attack telemetry in 2015 indicates the Dust Storm 
group has migrated from more traditional government 
and defense-related intelligence targets to exclusively 
seek out organizations involved in Japanese critical 
infrastructure and resources. 

The group recently compromised a wide breadth of 
victims across the following industry verticals: electricity 
generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, 
and construction. SPEAR’s current research indicates 
the group’s present focus has shifted to specifically 
and exclusively target Japanese companies or Japanese 
subdivisions of larger foreign organizations. 

The Early Days: Spear Phishing 

The earliest indications of the group’s activities stem 
from the compile times of the executable resource 
section of Misdat samples. All of the early backdoor 
samples were compiled using a version of Delphi which 
notoriously mangles the compilation timestamp of 
the file to June 19, 1992 22:22:17 UTC. By using the 
executable resource section timestamp, SPEAR was 
able to more accurately gauge the actual compile 
times of these samples, and traced one of them, 
"bc3b36474c24edca4f063161b25bfe0c90b378b9c19c”, 
to January 20101. 


1 During analysis of older command and control infrastructure, there were several domains that resolved to known malicious IP addresses in 
September 2009. However, SPEAR was not able to corroborate these dates in any known malware samples.

Figure 3: Other Later Targeted Attacks Leveraging DeployJava.js
Also of note in this attack: the final payload (hxxp://mail. 
glkjcorp.com/pic/win.exe) was delivered encoded with 
a single-byte XOR against the byte 0x95, skipping both 
the key itself and zero in an attempt to avoid exposing 
the key. This method of obfuscation at the time would 
have ensured delivery of the payload past most IDS/IPS 
systems. The unencoded payload was a hybrid of the 
older Misdat backdoor and its next generation, the S-Type 
backdoor. The backdoor would first attempt to use the 
old Misdat network protocol and communicate to “smtp. 
adobekr.com”. If that failed, it would fallback to the newer 
HTTP-based S-Type protocol which communicated with 
“mail.glkcorp.com”. 

The group completely abandoned older incarnations of 
the Misdat backdoor for their first stage implants in 2013, 
and moved predominantly to the new S-Type backdoors. 
A full analysis of both of these backdoors is included in 
the “Implant Analysis” section.

Into the Future: Japanese Targets 

SPEAR noticed a fairly large lull in activity from March 
2013 to August 2013. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), 
Mandiant released their APT 1 report on February 19, 2013 
(https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013 
/02/mandiant-exposes-apt1-chinas-cyber-espionageunits.
html). Activity didn’t cease entirely, but the volume 
of malware SPEAR was able to collect during this period 
was remarkably decreased. 

Several new domains were registered during this time 
period, which would go on to become the crux of the 
group’s operations for the next several years. 

There was some anecdotal evidence to suggest Operation 
Dust Storm leveraged an Ichitaro zero-day “CVE-20135990” 
to target Japanese victims. This zero-day was first 
reported publicly on November 12, 2013. Ichitaro is a

Activity in 2015 was significantly more interesting, and prompted SPEAR 
to begin studying Operation Dust Storm’s other activities. SPEAR identified 
a number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and 
credentials. These proxy addresses revealed the attacker had compromised 
a number of Japanese companies involved in power generation, oil and 
natural gas, construction, finance, and transportation.

CONCLUSION 

At this time, SPEAR does not believe the attacks were meant to be destructive or disruptive. However, our team believes that 
attacks of this nature on companies involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources are ongoing and are likely to 
continue to escalate in the future. 

It’s clear from SPEAR’s research that Operation Dust Storm has slowly evolved over time to become increasingly effective. 
Early operations were extremely blunt, relatively unsophisticated, and readily picked up by the security industry. As the group 
became more and more focused on Japan, less and less of their tactics and malware appeared in reports or write-ups. The 
targets identified escalated both in size and in the scope of affected industries. 

As a result, SPEAR felt obligated to share with the community and public what was discovered recently, to hopefully stunt the 
attackers’ progress for a time. SPEAR has been closely following the aftermath of public reporting. We have decided that even 
though disclosure often forces attackers to change, it also enables defenders to better detect and expel “real” threats from 
their environments. 

SPEAR would like to thank the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team (JP-CERT) for their cooperation, assistance, and 
time during our investigation. 

NOTE: A large number of the older Misdat domains were sinkholed by a private entity in late December 2015. The 
domains currently point to the IP address “58.158.177.102”. If anyone has more information or knows who operates 
this sinkhole, please contact us at: threat-intel [at] cylance [dot] com. 

IMPLANT ANALYSIS 

MISDAT BACKDOOR (2010-2011) 

Most early samples of Misdat were not packed; however, following what appeared to be heightened awareness by security 
vendors, samples in late 2010 and 2011 were typically packed with the executable packer, UPX version 3.03 (hxxp://upx. 
sourceforge.net/). All of the Misdat samples SPEAR identified were programmed using Borland Delphi, which will mangle the 
default PE compile timestamp of a file; as a result, SPEAR was forced to use the resource compile times of samples to get a 
better idea of when the actual backdoors were compiled.

HOST-BASED INDICATORS 

Volatile Evidence: 

• Will create a 32-bit Mutex based upon the MD5 hash of a unique string comprising the volume serial number, decrypted 
network configuration data, and encoded campaign identifier 
File System Modifications: 

• The backdoor will copy itself to %CommonFiles%\{Unique Identifier}\msdtc.exe 
• It may attempt to open then delete the file C:\2.hiv, c:\t2svzmp.kbp, or c:\tmp.kbm depending on the sample. Later 
versions from 2011 all used c:\t2svzmp.kbp 
Registry Modifications: 

• The malware may create the registry key HKCU\Software\dnimtsoleht\StubPath, HKCU\Software\snimtsOleht\StubPath, 
or HKCU\Software\Backtsaleht\StubPath for persistence 
• In SPEAR’s tests, StubPath always pointed to the newly created msdtc.exe binary within the %CommonFiles% directory, 
with either the “/ok” or “/start” switch depending on the sample 
• May create the Registry Key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed. Components\{3bf41072-b2b1-21c8b5c1-
bd56d32fbda7} or HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{3ef41072-a2f1-21c8-c5c170c2c3bc7905}

NETWORK-BASED INDICATORS 

Observed network traffic was always base64 encoded plain text over a raw socket to common ports like 80, 443, or 1433. A 
sample initial beacon packet is shown below. 

logon|{Hostname}|Windows XP|100112|bd56d32fbda703a98c87689c92325d90| 

Figure 6: Initial Beacon Packet Base64 Decoded 


The string “logon” always preceded any other information. In the instance above, the hostname of the victim’s system, 
operating system version, unique sample identifier (SPEAR believes this is a date: 1/12/2010), as well as the unique MD5 
used for the mutex were sent to the server. Once it registers with the C2, the backdoor sends the string “YWN0aXZlfA==” 
which decodes to “active|”. The backdoor will then continue to send that string and wait until it receives one of the following 
commands from the C2 server: 

Command Function 
shell Initiates a new connection that provides shell functionality to the attacker to 
execute commands. Subcommands include shellstart, command and stop. 
Initiates a new connection that provides file management and enumeration 
files capabilities to the attacker. Subcommands include filelist, dirlist, driver (enumerates 
logical drives), renamefile, delete, run, open and stop. 

upload Provides the ability to upload files directly to the C2. 
down Provides the ability to download files from the C2. 
restart Restarts the victim system through a call to the Windows API ExitWindowsEx. 
closeos Shuts down the system via ExitWindowsEx API. 
dclose Closes the socket connection to the C2.

unintall Deletes the Active Setup registry key and deletes the backdoor before terminating 
the process. 

Figure 7: Network Commands Supported by the Misdat Backdoor 


DETAILS 

The backdoors were relatively simple and provided the attacker the ability to upload and download files, manipulate and 
enumerate files, execute shell commands, disconnect from the C2, uninstall the backdoor, and shutdown or restart the system. 
The backdoors could also potentially take the command line parameters “/ok” or “/start”; the switches changed the user context 
under which the process runs. If no switch was provided when executed, the backdoor will copy itself to “%CommonFiles%\ 
{Unique Identifier}\msdtc.exe”, where the unique identifier is the first ten characters of the MD5 hash used as the mutex. It will 
then configure one of the Active Setup and associated registry keys above to establish persistence on the system. 

SPEAR identified and reversed the encoding mechanism used for obfuscating network callback information and what appeared 
to be a unique campaign identifier. The following script can be used to decode these obfuscated strings.

MIS-TYPE HYBRID BACKDOOR (2012) 

In 2012, Operation Dust Storm slowly migrated to a hybridized backdoor, which actually contained two entirely separate 
backdoors within the same binary. This backdoor would first attempt to establish an interactive shell using the Misdat base64 
encoded network protocol over a raw TCP socket. If the initial communication to the first C2 failed, the backdoor would fallback 
to a secondary HTTP-based protocol and communicate to an alternate C2. Hybrid variants SPEAR identified were compressed 
with UPX version 3.03.

HOST-BASED INDICATORS 

Volatile Evidence: 

• Will create a 32-bit Mutex based upon the MD5 hash of a unique string comprised of the volume serial number, decrypted 
network configuration data, encoded network configuration data, and encoded campaign identifier 
• May create a temporary user on the system named “Lost_{Unique Identifier}” with the password “fuck~!@6”{Unique 
Identifier}” 
• May create the folder %System%\{Unique Identifier} temporarily. 
• May create files in %AppData%\{Unique Identifier} that end in “tmp.exe” 
• May create the files: 
• %AppData%\{Unique Identifier}\HOSTRURKLSR 
• Contains the results of the command “cmd.exe /c ipconfig /all” 
• %AppData%\{Unique Identifier}\NEWERSSEMP 
• Contains the results of the command “cmd.exe /c net user {Username}” 
File System Modifications: 

• The backdoor will copy itself to %AppData%\{Unique Identifier}\msdtc.exe – where the unique identifier is the first ten 
characters of the MD5 hash 
Registry Modifications: 

• The malware may create the registry key HKCU\Software\bkfouerioyou 
• Creates the value StubPath pointing to %AppData%\{Unique Identifier}\msdtc.exe 
• Will create one of these registry keys for persistence: 
• HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{6afa8072-b2b1-31a8-b5c1{
Unique Identifier} – First 12bytes 
• HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{3BF41072-B2B1-31A8-B5C1{
Unique Identifier} – First 12bytes 
NETWORK-BASED INDICATORS 

The malware will make DNS requests for the domains “smtp.adobekr.com” and “mail.glkjcorp.com” or “auto.glkjcorp.com”. 
Both samples were configured to communicate first to “smtp.adobekr.com” using the Misdat network protocol described 
above over TCP port 80, 443, and 25. If a response was not received from the C2, the samples would fallback to the secondary 
HTTP protocol and communicate to the alternate C2 using the same TCP ports.

The initial POST request always used the static User-Agent “FirefoxApp” and contained operating system information, user 
information, the results of several permissions tests, the file system, and system uptime. If the backdoor did not receive a 
response, it would then try to communicate the same base64 encoded information in the URI of a GET request.

The id and mmid fields in the figures above both used the first 16 characters of the unique identifier created for the mutex. The 
Misdat protocol provided the attacker most of the features of a full-fledged backdoor, while the secondary protocol appeared 
to primarily be used as an update mechanism to load additional malware on the system.

NETWORK-BASED INDICATORS 

DETAILS 

The backdoor could be executed with three different switches, “/ok”, “/Start”, or “/fuck”. These switches affected the context 
under which the process would be run and whether or not the binary would delete itself once executed. 

Switch Descriptive Purpose Self-Delete 
/ok Executed the malware directly under the current running process using the context 
of the user that started the application (can be system). No 
Executed the malware under explorer.exe in the context of whatever user executed 
/Start the application (can be system). This was the switch used by the malware when No 
setting persistence in the registry. 
/fuck Forced execution of the malware under explorer.exe in the context of the user 
running explorer.exe (scanned active processes and located the explorer process). No 

Started the malware in a process called msdtc.exe which ran as an orphaned

Figure 14: Description of Command Line Execution Switches for the Backdoor 


The backdoor attempted to run a number of tests to determine the privilege level of the compromised user, including whether 
or not a user can be added to the system, whether a directory can be created in the %System% folder, and whether the user can 
access the service manager via a call to “OpenSCManagerA”. 

The user test was performed by utilizing the NetUserAdd and NetUserDel Windows APIs; the test attempted to create the 
temporary user “Lost_{Unique Identifier}” with the password “fuck~!@6{Unique Identifier}”. If the secondary network protocol 
was activated, the backdoor would also execute two commands via the command interpreter to gather system information: 
“cmd.exe /c ipconfig /all” and “cmd.exe /c net user {Username}”. It would temporarily write the output of these commands to 
the files, “%AppData%\{Unique Identifier}\HOSTRURKLSR” and “%AppData%\{Unique Identifier}\NEWERSSEMP” respectively. 
This information was then base64 encoded and transmitted to the C2 server within the URI of a GET request. The S-Type 
network protocol is described in greater detail below. Also of note is that the backdoor would continue to attempt to beacon to 
“smtp.adobekr.com” on port 25 even if communication to the secondary C2 could be established. 

The configuration information contained within these backdoors could be decoded using the same script provided in Figure 8.

S-TYPE BACKDOOR (2013-2014) 

After experimenting with a hybrid of the Misdat and S-Type backdoors, in 2013 Operation Dust Storm abandoned the earlier 
Misdat network protocol entirely. This was likely a direct result of the demonstrated effectiveness of an HTTP-based protocol 
for command and control, or simply an adaptation to more corporations leveraging web-based proxies. All samples identified 
were programmed using Borland Delphi and made use of custom classes to implement common backdoor functionality. The 
majority of samples SPEAR identified in 2013 were packed with UPX version 3.03, while later 2014 variants were not.

NETWORK-BASED INDICATORS 

The backdoor communicated to "ssl.projectscorp.net" and "pic.elecarrow.com" primarily on port 80; however, communication 
would also fallback to port 443 or 8080 if initial communication failed. The backdoor used HTTP to communicate with the C2 
servers; data was transmitted base64 encoded in the URI of GET requests or sent in the body of a POST request. It used two 
hardcoded User-Agents, “FirefoxApp” and “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)” in initial requests, as well 
as the default User-Agent of the system in its later communications.

The backdoor attempts to run a number of tests to determine the privilege level of the compromised user, including 
whether or not a user can be added to the system, whether a directory can be created in the %System% folder, and whether 
the user can access the service manager. This information is transmitted along with the type of file system and any proxy 
information necessary to access the Internet. The backdoor may also make network requests with the following variables 
in the URI “&type=ie&”, “stype=info&data=”, “stype=srv&data=”, “stype=con&data=”, “stype=user&data=”, “mmid=”, 
“&type=post&stype=”, or “&status=”. 

DETAILS 

In a similar way as previous Dust Storm backdoors, this one attempted to detect whether or not the victim was using a Japanese 
keyboard via the “GetKeyboardType” API. The backdoor itself provided the attacker the ability to execute shell commands, 
enumerate system and network information, manipulate files, and download and execute an arbitrary file. Initial observations 
suggest this was largely a reconnaissance platform that would then be upgraded by the attacker to a full-featured backdoor. 

The backdoor performed the initial tests described above by first attempting to add the user “Lost_{Unique Identifier}” with 
the password “pond~!@ {Unique Identifier}” to the system using the NetUserAdd API; if successful, it then removed this 
user via the NetUserDel API. The backdoor then attempted to create the folder “%System%\{Unique Identifier}” with the 
CreateDirectoryA API and removed it using the RemoveDirectoryA API. Once these two tests were complete, it attempted to 
access the Windows Service Control Manager through a call to “OpenSCManagerA”. Once it communicated this information 
along with proxy and file system info via the initial POST requests, the backdoor attempted to execute a sequence of commands 
to enumerate information about the system and local network. 

“net start” 
“Ipconfig /all”
“net user” or “net user /domain” depending on the value of %USERDNSDOMAIN% 
Figure 20: Initial Commands Executed on the System by the Backdoor 


The results of these commands are transmitted base64 encoded as the data parameter within the URI, “/pic/index. 
asp?id={Unique_Identifier}&type=ie&stype=info&data=”. Once the results of these commands are transmitted back to the 
C2 server, the backdoor will continue to beacon to the URI “/pic/index.asp?mmid={Unique Identifier}” and wait for either 
commands to execute or an updated binary to download and execute. Any file downloaded from the C2 is sent base64 encoded 
and has the name “{Unique Identifier}.txt”. If the file is a binary, it is written to disk as “tmp.exe” and executed via WinExec. The 
backdoor will then communicate back to the C2 with either “&status=run succeed” if successful, or “&status=Error Code” if 
there was an error. 

The "{Unique Identifier}" referenced above is an eight-character hex-string calculated by adding the volume serial number of 
the C drive (or D drive if there is no C) and a CRC32 hash of the first 0x90 bytes of the encoded configuration for the backdoor. 
This was quite different from the earlier Misdat variants, as it can be reversed to yield the serial number of the drive. The 
backdoor decodes its configuration information from offset 0xE9FC. It skips the first 4 bytes, then subtracts 0x2 from each 
byte and XOR’s the resultant values with the first byte of the configuration block, 0x58 in this case.

Figure 22: Decoded Configuration Block
Text strings in the decoded block are each prefaced by their length in hex. In addition to the URL “hxxp://ssl.projectscorp.net/ 
pic/index.asp” and the domain “pic.elecarrow.com”, the ports that attempt to beacon on 80, 443, and 8080 are highlighted in 
green, blue, and purple respectively. The following Python function can be used to decode these configuration blocks. 

def sub_single_byte_xor(buf,subb, key):
out = ‘’ 
for i in buf: 
out += chr((ord(i)-subb) ^ key) 
return out 
sub_single_byte_xor(buf,0x2,0x58)

ZLIB BACKDOOR (2014-2015) 

This backdoor was the preferred second-stage implant for the group throughout 2014 and 2015. The malware was a full-
featured backdoor with built-in NTLM proxy authentication support which was designed to be run as a ServiceDLL. Each 
sample SPEAR identified was customized to the specific victim environment and programmed using Microsoft Visual C++ 6. 
As a result, our team has included hashes of samples that were modified to redact victim information. SPEAR has provided as 
much information as possible so other victims can identify incidents.

The backdoor communicates to the preconfigured C2 servers via HTTP POST and GET requests. The contents of the 
communications are compressed using the standard Zlib compression library (http://www.zlib.net/). During SPEAR’s limited 
testing, the User-Agent was always static and set to “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)”.

Figure 26: Decompressed Contents of Initial POST Request
The hostname, context the backdoor was running under, operating system information, and user information were transmitted 
back to the C2 during a controlled test. 

DETAILS 

Anecdotal evidence suggests the attackers made few modifications to the backdoors themselves and instead simply updated 
the configuration information as needed. As a result, most of the backdoors identified had a PE checksum mismatch between 
the stated value and calculated value. The backdoor provided the attacker with the ability to upload and download files, 
enumerate files and drives, enumerate system information, enumerate and manipulate Windows services, enumerate and 
impersonate logon sessions, mimic keystrokes and mouse input, capture screenshots, and execute shell commands. 

The backdoor itself contained very few unique plain-text strings or any other type of identifying information outside of the 
Import Table. The backdoor would initialize strings of interest on the stack by pushing one character at a time; this method 
has become increasingly common among malware authors to avoid antivirus heuristic methods. The backdoor’s configuration 
information was stored Zlib compressed within the binary with the size of the compressed data saved as a double word right 
before the start of the header “0x78 0x9C”. The decompressed data contained the Windows service name, Windows display

name, and a description for the service. It also contained the filename the backdoor would use, the domain names and ports 

to beacon on, and the internal corporate proxy to use.
