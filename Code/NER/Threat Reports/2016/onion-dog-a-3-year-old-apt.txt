/PRNewswire/ 
--The 
Helios 
Team 
at 
360 
SkyEye 
Labs 
recently 
revealed 
that 
a 
hacker 
group 
named 
OnionDog 
has 
been 
infiltrating 
and 
stealing 
information 
from 
the 
energy,� 
transportation 
and 
other 
infrastructure 
industries 
of 
Korean-language 
countries 
through 
the 
Internet. 
According 
to 
big 
data 
correlation 
analysis, 
OnionDog's 
first 
activity 
can 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
October, 
2013� 
and 
in 
the 
following 
two 
years 
it 
was 
only 
active 
between 
late 
July 
and 
early 
September. 
The 
self-set 
life 
cycle 
of 
a 
Trojan 
attack 
is 
15 
days 
on 
average 
and 
is 
distinctly 
organizational 
and 
objective-oriented. 


OnionDog 
malware 
is 
transmitted 
by 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
popular 
office 
software� 
Hangul 
in 
Korean-language 
countries, 
and 
it 
attacked 
network-isolated 
targets 
through 
a 
USB 
Worm. 
In 
addition, 
OnionDog 
also 
used 
darkweb 
("Onion 
City") 
communications 
tools, 
with 
which 
it 
can 
visit 
the 
domain 
without 
the 
Onion 
browser, 
making 
its 
real 
identity 
hidden 
in 
the 
completely 
anonymous 
Tor 
network. 


OnionDog 
APT 
targets 
the 
infrastructure 
industry. 


OnionDog 
concentrated 
its 
efforts 
on 
􀀀infrastructure 
industries 
in 
Korean-language 
countries. 
In 
2015 
this 
organization 
mainly 
attacked 
harbors, 
VTS, 
subways, 
public 
transportation 
and 
other 
transportation 
systems. 
In 
2014 
it 
attacked 
many 
electric 
power 
and 
water 
resources 
corporations 
as 
well 
as 
other 
energy 
enterprises. 


360's 
Threat 
Intelligence 
Center 
has 
found 
96 
groups 
of 
malicious 
code, 
14 
C&C 
domain 
names 
and 
IP 
related 
to 
OnionDog. 
It 
first 
surfaced 
in 
􀀀October 
2013, 
and 
then 
was 
most 
active 
in 
the 
summers 
of 
the 
following 
years. 
The 
Trojan 
set 
its 
own 
"active 
state" 
time 
and 
the 
shortest 
was 
be 
three 
days 
and 
maximum 
twenty 
nine 
days, 
from 
compilation 
to 
the 
end 
of 
activity. 
The 
average 
life 
cycle 
is 
15 
days, 
which 
makes 
it 
more 
difficult 
for 
the 
victim 
enterprises 
to 
notice 
and 
take 
actions 
than 
those 
active 
for 
longer� 
period 
of 
time.

The 
life 
cycle 
of 
Trojan 
malware 


OnionDog's 
attacks 
are 
mainly 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
form 
of 
spear 
phishing 
emails. 
The 
early 
Trojan 
used 
icons 
and 
file 
numbers 
to 
create 
a 
fake 
HWP 
file 
(Hangul's 
file 
format). 
Later 
on, 
the 
Trojan 
used 
a 
vulnerability 
in� 
an 
upgraded 
version 
of 
Hangul, 
which 
imbeds 
malicious 
code 
in 
a 
real 
HWP 
file. 
Once 
the 
file 
is 
opened,� 
the 
vulnerability 
will 
be 
triggered 
to 
download 
and 
activate 
the 
Trojan. 



Since 
most 
infrastructure 
industries, 
such 
as 
the 
energy 
industry, 
generally 
adopt 
intranet 
isolation 
measures, 
OnionDog 
uses 
the 
USB 
disk 
drive 
ferry 
to 
break 
the 
false 
sense 
of 
security 
of 
physical 
isolation. 
In 
the 
classic 
APT 
case 
of 
the 
Stuxnet 
virus, 
which 
broke 
into 
an 
Iranian 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
the 
virus 
used 
an 
employee's 
USB 
disk 
to 
circumvent 
network 
isolation. 
OnionDog 
also 
used 
this 
channel 
and 
generated 
USB 
worms 
to 
infiltrate 
the 
target 
internal 
network.� 


"OCD-type" 
intensive 
organization 


In 
the 
Malicious 
Code 
activities 
of 
OnionDog, 
there 
are 
strict 
regulations: 


First, 
the 
Malicious 
Code 
has 
strict 
naming 
rules 
starting 
from 
the 
path 
of 
created 
PDB 
(symbol 
file). 
For� 
example, 
the 
path 
for 
USB 
worm 
is 
APT-USB, 
and 
the 
path 
for 
spear 
mail 
file 
is 
APT-WebServer;� 


When 
the 
OnionDog 
Trojan 
is 
successfully 
released, 
it 
will 
communicate 
to 
a 
C&C 
(Trojan 
server), 
download 
other 
malware 
and 
save 
them 
in 
the 
%temp% 
folder 
and 
use 
"XXX_YYY.jpg" 
uniformly 
as 
the 
file 
name.� 
These 
names 
have 
their 
special 
meaning 
and 
usually 
point 
to 
the 
target. 


All 
signs 
show 
that 
OnionDog 
has 
strict 
organization 
and 
arrangement 
across 
its 
attack 
time, 
target, 
vulnerability 
exploration 
and 
utilization, 
and 
malicious 
code. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
is 
very 
cautious 
about 
covering 
up 
its 
tracks. 


In 
2014, 
OnionDog 
used 
many 
fixed 
IPs 
in 
􀀀South 
Korea 
as 
its 
C&C 
sites. 
Of 
course, 
this 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
attacker 
is 
located 
in 
South 
Korea. 
These 
IPs 
could 
be 
used 
as 
puppets 
and 
jumping 
boards. 
By 
2015, 
OnionDog 
website 
communications 
were 
upgraded 
to 
Onion 
City 
across 
the 
board. 
This 
is 
so 
far 
a 
relatively 
more 
advanced 
and 
covert 
method 
of 
network 
communication 
among 
APT 
hacker 
attacks. 


Onion 
City 
means 
that 
the 
deep 
web 
searching 
engine 
uses 
Tor2web 
agent 
technology 
to 
visit 
the 
anonymous 
Tor 
network 
deeply 
without 
using 
the 
Onion 
Brower 
specifically. 
And 
OnionDog 
uses 
the 
Onion� 
City 
to 
hide 
the 
Trojan-controlling 
server 
in 
the 
Tor 
network. 


In 
recent 
years, 
APT 
attacks 
on 
infrastructure 
facilities 
and 
large-scale 
enterprises 
have 
frequently 
emerged. 
Some 
that 
attack 
an 
industrial 
control 
system, 
such 
as 
Stuxnet, 
Black 
Energy 
and 
so 
on, 
can 
have 
devastating 
results. 
Some 
attacks 
are 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
stealing 
information, 
such 
as 
the 
Lazarus 
hacker 
organization 
jointly 
revealed 
by 
Kaspersky, 
AlienVault 
lab 
and 
Novetta, 
and 
OnionDog 
which 
was 
recently 
exposed 
by 
the 
360 
Helios 
team. 
These 
secret 
cybercrimes 
can 
cause 
similarly 
serious 
losses 
as 
well. 


In 
view 
of 
OnionDog's 
pattern 
of 
activity, 
we 
are 
likely 
to 
observe 
a 
new 
round 
of 
attacks 
this 
summer. 
The 
relevant 
threat 
intelligence 
and 
technical 
analysis 
report 
will 
be

by 
360's

Helios 
Team 
is 
a 
senior 
threat 
research 
team 
at 
Qihoo 
360 
that 
is 
engaged 
in 
detecting 
and 
tracing 
APT 
attacks, 
internet 
security 
incident 
response, 
hacker 
industrial

exploration 
and 
study. 
The 
team 
was 
established 
in 
December 
2014. 
Within 
a 
year, 
it 
integrated 
the 
enormous 
security 
data 
at 
Qihoo 
360 
and 
realized 
the 
rapid 
correlation 
traceability 
of 
threat 
intelligence, 
and 
for 
the 
first 
time 
found 
and 
traced 
10� 
APT 
organizations 
and 
hacker 
industrial 
chains. 
It 
broadened 
its 
horizon 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
hacker 
industry, 
filled 
the 
void 
of 
APT 
study 
domestically 
and 
􀀀has 
offered 
security 
threat 
evaluation 
and 
solutions 
output 
for� 
many 
enterprises 
and 
government 
agencies.
